<p>I came into this<br>
world as a reject<br>
Look into<br>
these eyes<br>
Then you&rsquo;ll see the<br>
size of the flames<br>
Dwellin&rsquo;<br>
on the past<br>
It&rsquo;s burinin&rsquo;<br>
up my brain<br>
Everyone<br>
that burns<br>
Has to learn<br>
from the pain<br>
Hey I think<br>
about the day<br>
My girlie ran away<br>
with my pay<br>
When my fellas<br>
came to play<br>
Now she&rsquo;s<br>
stuck with my<br>
Homeez that<br>
she fucked<br>
And I&rsquo;m just a<br>
sucker with a lump<br>
In my<br>
throat hey<br>
Like a chump hey<br>
like a chump<br>
Hey like<br>
a chump hey<br>
Like a chump hey<br>
like a chump<br>
Hey like a chump<br>
hey like a chump hey<br>
Should I be<br>
feelin&rsquo; bad<br>
Should I be<br>
feelin&rsquo; good<br>
It&rsquo;s kinda sad<br>
I&rsquo;m the laughing<br>
Stock of the<br>
neighborhood<br>
You would think that<br>
I&rsquo;d be movin&rsquo; on<br>
But I&rsquo;m a sucker<br>
like a I said<br>
Fucked up in the<br>
head not<br>
Maybe she just<br>
made a mistake<br>
I should give<br>
her a break<br>
My heart will ache<br>
either way<br>
Hey what<br>
the hell<br>
Watch you want<br>
me to say<br>
I won&rsquo;t lie<br>
that I can&rsquo;t deny<br>
I did it all<br>
for the nookie<br>
C&rsquo;mon the nookie<br>
c&rsquo;mon<br>
So you can take<br>
that cookie<br>
And stick it<br>
up your yeah<br>

Stick it<br>

Why did it<br>
take so long<br>
Why did I wait<br>
so long huh<br>
To figure it out<br>
but I did it<br>
And I&rsquo;m the<br>
only one<br>
Underneath the sun<br>
who didn&rsquo;t get it<br>
I can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I could be deceived<br>
By my so called girl<br>
but in reality<br>
Had a hidden a<br>
genda<br>
She put my tender<br>
heart in a blender<br>
And still<br>
I surrendered<br>
Hey like a chump<br>

It&rsquo;s so easy for<br>
your friends<br>
To give<br>
their advice<br>
They tell you<br>
to let it go<br>
But it&rsquo;s easier<br>
said than done<br>
I appreciate it<br>
I do<br>
But just<br>
leave me alone<br>
Leave me alone<br>
just leave me alone<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;<br>
gonna change<br>
You can<br>
