    <p>작곡: Sung by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=60782" target="_black">60782</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been<br>
three weeks<br>
Since<br>
you&rsquo;ve been<br>
Looking for<br>
your friend<br>
The one you<br>
let hit it<br>
And never<br>
called you again<br>
&lsquo;Member when<br>
he told you<br>
He was &lsquo;bout<br>
the Benjamins<br>
You act<br>
like you ain&rsquo;t<br>
Hear him then gave<br>
him a little trim<br>
To begin<br>
how you<br>
Think you<br>
really gon&rsquo; pretend<br>
Like you<br>
wasn&rsquo;t down<br>
Then you<br>
called him again<br>
Plus when you<br>
give it up<br>
So easy you ain&rsquo;t<br>
even fooling him<br>
If you did it<br>
then then<br>
You probably<br>
Xuck again<br>
Talking out your<br>
neck sayin&rsquo;<br>
You&rsquo;re a<br>
Christian<br>
A Muslim sleeping<br>
with the gin<br>
Now that was<br>
the sin that<br>
Did Jezebel<br>
in Who you<br>
Gon&rsquo; tell when the<br>
repercussions spin<br>
Showing off<br>
your ass<br>
&lsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re<br>
thinking it&rsquo;s a trend<br>
Girlfriend<br>
let me<br>
Break it down<br>
for you again<br>
You know I<br>
only say it<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m<br>
truly genuine<br>
Don&rsquo;t be a<br>
hardrock<br>
When you&rsquo;re<br>
really a gem<br>
Babygirl<br>
respect is<br>
Just a minimum<br>
Niggas Xucked up<br>
And you still<br>
defending them<br>
Now Lauryn is<br>
only human<br>
Don&rsquo;t think<br>
I haven&rsquo;t been<br>
Through the<br>
same predicament<br>
Let it sit<br>
inside your<br>
Head like a million<br>
women in Philly Penn<br>
It&rsquo;s silly<br>
when girls sell<br>
Their soul<br>
because it&rsquo;s in<br>
Look at where<br>
you be in<br>
Hair weaves<br>
like Europeans<br>
Fake nails<br>
done by Koreans<br>
Come again<br>
Come again<br>
Come again<br>
come again<br>
Come again<br>
Guys you<br>
Know you<br>
better watch out<br>
Some girls some<br>
girls are only about<br>
That thing that thing<br>
that thing<br>
That thing that thing<br>
that thing<br>
The second verse is<br>
dedicated to the men<br>
More concerned<br>
with his rims<br>
And his Timbs<br>
than his women<br>
Him and his<br>
men come in<br>
The club<br>
like hooligans<br>
Don&rsquo;t care<br>
who they offend<br>
Popping yang<br>
like you got yen<br>
Let&rsquo;s not pretend<br>
they wanna<br>
Pack pistol by<br>
they waist men<br>
Cristal by<br>
the case men<br>
Still in they<br>
mother&rsquo;s basement<br>
The pretty face<br>
men claiming<br>
That they<br>
did a bid men<br>
Need to take<br>
care of their<br>
Three and<br>
four kids men<br>
They facing<br>
a court case<br>
When the child&rsquo;s<br>
support late<br>
Money taking<br>
heart breaking<br>
Now you wonder why<br>
women hate men<br>
The sneaky<br>
silent men<br>
The punk domestic<br>
violence men<br>
The quick to<br>
shoot the semen<br>
Stop acting like<br>
boys and be men<br>
How you<br>
gon&rsquo; win<br>
When you ain&rsquo;t<br>
right within<br>
How you<br>
gon&rsquo; win<br>
When you ain&rsquo;t<br>
right within<br>
How you<br>
gon&rsquo; win<br>
When you ain&rsquo;t<br>
right within<br>
Come again<br>
Come again<br>
Come again<br>
come again<br>
Come<br>
again</p>
<p>Girls you know you<br>
better watch out<br>
Some guys some<br>
guys are only about<br>
That thing that thing<br>
that thing<br>
That thing that thing<br>
that thing<br>
Guys you know you<br>
better watch out<br>
Some girls some<br>
girls are only about<br>
That thing that thing<br>
that thing<br>
That thing that thing<br>
that thing<br>
Girls you know you<br>
better watch out<br>
Some guys some guys<br>
are only about<br>
That thing that thing<br>
that thing<br>
That thing that thing<br>
that thing</p>
