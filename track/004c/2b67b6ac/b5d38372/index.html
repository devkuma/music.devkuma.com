<p>I Don&rsquo;t know<br>
who to trust<br>
No surprise<br>
Everyone<br>
feels so far<br>
away from me<br>
Heavy thoughts<br>
sift through<br>
dust And<br>
the lies<br>
Trying not to break<br>
But I&rsquo;m so<br>
tired of<br>
this deceit<br>
Every time<br>
I try to make myself<br>
Get back up<br>
on my feet<br>
All I ever<br>
think about is<br>
this All the<br>
tiring time<br>
between<br>
And how<br>
Trying to put<br>
my trust in you<br>
Just takes so<br>
much out of me<br>
I take everything<br>
from the inside<br>
And throw<br>
it all away<br>
&lsquo;Cause I swear<br>
for the last time<br>
I won&rsquo;t trust<br>
myself with you<br>
Tension is building<br>
inside Steadily<br>
Everyone feels so<br>
far away from me<br>
Heavy thoughts<br>
forcing<br>
their way<br>
Out of me<br>
Trying not to break<br>
But I&rsquo;m so<br>
tired of<br>
this deceit<br>
Every time<br>
I try to make<br>
myself Get back<br>
up on my feet<br>
All I ever think<br>
about is this<br>
All the tiring<br>
time between And how<br>
Trying to put<br>
my trust in you<br>
Just takes so<br>
much out of me<br>
I take everything<br>
from the inside<br>
And throw<br>
it all away<br>
&lsquo;Cause I swear for<br>
the last time<br>
I won&rsquo;t trust<br>
myself with you<br>
I won&rsquo;t trust myself<br>
with you you you<br>
I won&rsquo;t waste myself<br>
on you you you<br>
I take everything<br>
from the inside<br>
And throw<br>
it all away<br>
&lsquo;Cause I swear<br>
for the last time<br>
I won&rsquo;t trust<br>
myself with you<br>
Everything<br>
from the inside<br>
And throw<br>
it all away<br>
&lsquo;Cause I swear<br>
for the last time<br>
I won&rsquo;t trust myself<br>
with you you you</p>
