<p>Can I tell you<br>
a story<br>
About a boy who broke<br>
his own heart<br>
And he always blamed<br>
everybody else<br>
But<br>
the truth is<br>
That he did it<br>
to himself<br>
Made a couple songs<br>
and they got big<br>
And thought<br>
that he could do<br>
Whatever he wanted<br>
but it all<br>
Left him with a hole<br>
in his heart<br>
Woo money buys you<br>
happiness<br>
But woo<br>
doesn&rsquo;t buy you time<br>
The more<br>
that I get older<br>
The less<br>
I wanna be sober<br>
And I can&rsquo;t quit<br>
goddxxx it<br>
And maybe<br>
I&rsquo;m just broken<br>
And<br>
I&rsquo;ll never admit it<br>
But I wish<br>
that I was younger<br>
Yeah<br>
twenty-six and rich<br>
How the hell did it<br>
come to this<br>
And I wish<br>
I could tell you<br>
That everything is<br>
perfect<br>
But it&rsquo;s not<br>
I was staring<br>
At the ceiling for<br>
like ten days<br>
But I&rsquo;m pretty sure<br>
that I forgot<br>
What it&rsquo;s like<br>
to be a person<br>
That<br>
doesn&rsquo;t think<br>
That everything<br>
he does just sucks<br>
Oh it&rsquo;s a perfect<br>
world until it&rsquo;s not<br>
Woo money buys you<br>
happiness<br>
But woo<br>
doesn&rsquo;t buy you time<br>
The more<br>
that I get older<br>
The less<br>
I wanna be sober<br>
And I can&rsquo;t quit<br>
goddxxx it<br>
And maybe<br>
I&rsquo;m just broken<br>
And<br>
I&rsquo;ll never admit it<br>
But I wish<br>
that I was younger<br>
Yeah<br>
twenty-six and rich<br>
How the hell did it<br>
come to this<br>
The more<br>
that I get older<br>
The less<br>
I wanna be sober<br>
Yeah<br>
twenty-six and rich<br>
How the hell did it<br>
come to this</p>
