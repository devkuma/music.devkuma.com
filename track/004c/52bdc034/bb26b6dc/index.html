    <p>작곡: .., Lauv, Julia Michaels / 작사: Words &amp; Music by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=91328" target="_black">91328</a></p>
<p>You touch me and it&rsquo;s<br>
almost like we knew<br>
That there will be<br>
history between us two<br>
We knew someday that<br>
we would have regrets<br>
But we just ignored<br>
them the night we met<br>
We just dance<br>
backwards<br>
Into each other<br>
trying to keep<br>
Our feelings<br>
secretly covered<br>
You touch me and it&rsquo;s<br>
almost like we knew<br>
That<br>
there will be history<br>
But<br>
there&rsquo;s no way that<br>
It&rsquo;s not going<br>
there<br>
With<br>
the way that<br>
We&rsquo;re looking at<br>
each other<br>
There&rsquo;s no way that<br>
it&rsquo;s not going there<br>
Every second with you<br>
I want another<br>
But maybe we can hold<br>
off one sec<br>
So we can keep this<br>
tension in check<br>
But<br>
there&rsquo;s no way<br>
That it&rsquo;s not going<br>
there<br>
With<br>
the way that<br>
We&rsquo;re looking at<br>
each other<br>
I wish I could make<br>
the time stop<br>
So we could<br>
forget<br>
Everything<br>
and everyone<br>
I wish that the time<br>
would line up<br>
So we could just give<br>
in to what we want<br>
&lsquo;Cause when I got<br>
somebody you don&rsquo;t<br>
And when you got<br>
somebody I don&rsquo;t<br>
I wish that the time<br>
would line up<br>
So we could just<br>
give in<br>
But<br>
there&rsquo;s no way that<br>
It&rsquo;s not going<br>
there<br>
With<br>
the way that<br>
We&rsquo;re looking at<br>
each other<br>
There&rsquo;s no way that<br>
it&rsquo;s not going there<br>
Every second with you<br>
I want another<br>
But maybe we can hold<br>
off one sec<br>
So we can keep this<br>
tension in check<br>
There&rsquo;s no way that<br>
it&rsquo;s not going there<br>
With<br>
the way that<br>
We&rsquo;re looking at<br>
each other<br>
We just dance<br>
backwards<br>
Into each other<br>
trying to keep<br>
Our feelings<br>
secretly covered<br>
We just dance<br>
backwards<br>
Into each other<br>
trying to keep<br>
Our feelings<br>
secretly covered<br>
You touched me<br>
and<br>
It&rsquo;s almost<br>
like we knew<br>
That<br>
there would be history<br>
But<br>
there&rsquo;s no way that<br>
It&rsquo;s not going<br>

With<br>
the way that<br>

There&rsquo;s no way that<br>
it&rsquo;s not going there<br>
With<br>
the way that<br>
We&rsquo;re looking at<br>
each other<br>
We just keep on<br>
dancing<br>
Right into<br>
each other<br>
We just keep on<br>
dancing<br>
Right into<br>
each other</p>
