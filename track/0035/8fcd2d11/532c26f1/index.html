Erotic it is<br>

Had me thinking<br>
&lsquo;bout that ass<br>
After I&rsquo;m gone<br>

Spot at the<br>
right time<br>
Lights on<br>

She like it<br>
from behind<br>
So seductivel<br>

The way she wind<br>
her hips in slow-mo<br>
On the floor<br>
when we grind<br>
As long as<br>
she ain&rsquo;t<br>
Stoppin homie<br>
I ain&rsquo;t stoppin<br>
Drippin wet<br>
with sweat man<br>
Its on and popping<br>

Campaign bottle<br>

And we gon&rsquo; sip<br>
