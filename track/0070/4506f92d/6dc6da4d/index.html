<p>Run around all inside my brain<br>
Juliette<br>
I been waiting for your text all night<br>
Oh two can play this game<br>
Where you at<br>
Please don&rsquo;t run away out of my sight<br>
Be my ba-a-a-a-by<br>
Be my ba-a-a-a-by<br>
Why you keep on playin&rsquo;<br>
with my heart like surgery<br>
Got me asking<br>
what I did so wrong to have you curving me<br>
Know I used to mess up couple times<br>
but I&rsquo;m for real<br>
All I need is a chance<br>
Give you something he can&rsquo;t<br>
Girl you know me though<br>
Be your Romeo<br>
Push them others to the side<br>
And just call me up<br>
Hesitation did me wrong<br>
Now I&rsquo;m here but you&rsquo;re gone<br>
Could&rsquo;ve been anything that you want<br>
You&rsquo;re stuck inside my head<br>
I&rsquo;m rolling on my bed<br>
Thinkin&rsquo; bout all the things you said<br>
Makes me wish that I was dead<br>
All this money don&rsquo;t mean nothing<br>
When there&rsquo;s no one to spend it<br>
Hop on this whip my window&rsquo;s tinted<br>
And we riding<br>
I&rsquo;m tryna make you wifey<br>
Put a ring on it<br>
I don&rsquo;t care what the price is<br>
I promise<br>
No sneaky link or side piece<br>
A relation<br>
I&rsquo;m running out of patience<br>
Hit me up baby<br>
Run around all inside my brain<br>
Juliette<br>
I been waiting for your text all night<br>
Oh two can play this game<br>
Where you at<br>
Please don&rsquo;t run away out of my sight<br>
Be my ba-a-a-a-by<br>
Be my ba-a-a-a-by<br>
Hey baby<br>
Secret is that I miss u<br>
And when I kiss u<br>
Late night<br>
Got me reminiscing<br>
I should say to you<br>
Hey to you<br>
Playing hard to get<br>
I seem to play with uuu ohh<br>
And maybe next time<br>
I won&rsquo;t be so shy<br>
I&rsquo;ll tell u all the things I like<br>
I&rsquo;ll show u my bad side<br>
I&rsquo;ll be there like 3 times of week<br>
It shouldn&rsquo;t matter if<br>
outside of that we don&rsquo;t speak<br>
No no<br>
It&rsquo;s just u and me<br>
Floating free<br>
We could be anything<br>
Anything u ever wanted to be<br>
Cuz everything I ever wanted u see<br>
In me yeah<br>
Run around all inside my brain<br>
Juliette<br>
I been waiting for your text all night<br>
Oh two can play this game<br>
Where you at<br>
Please don&rsquo;t run away out of my sight<br>
Be my ba-a-a-a-by<br>
Be my ba-a-a-a-by</p>
