<p>Lock broken slur spoken<br>
Wound open game token<br>
I didn&rsquo;t know you were keeping count<br>
Rain soaking<br>
Blind hoping<br>
You said I was freeloading<br>
I didn&rsquo;t know you were keeping Count<br>
High infidelity<br>
Put on your records and regret me<br>
I bent the truth too far tonight<br>
I was dancing around dancing around it<br>
High infidelity<br>
Put on your headphones and burn my city<br>
Your Picket fence is sharp as knives<br>
I was dancing around dancing around it<br>
Do you really want to know<br>
Where I was April 29th?<br>
Do I really have to chart the constellations<br>
In his eyes?<br>
Storm coming good husband<br>
Bad omen<br>
Dragged my feet right down the aisle<br>
At the house lonely<br>
Good money<br>
I&rsquo;d pay if you&rsquo;d just know me<br>
Seemed like the right thing at the time<br>
You know there&rsquo;s many different ways<br>
That you can kill the one you love<br>
The slowest way is never loving them enough<br>
Do you really want to know<br>
Where I was April 29th?<br>
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me<br>
Back to life?<br>
High infidelity<br>
Put on your records and regret me<br>
I bent the truth too far tonight<br>
I was dancing around dancing around it<br>
High infidelity<br>
Put on your headphones and burn my city<br>
Your picket fence is sharp as knives<br>
I was dancing around dancing around it<br>
Do you really wanna know<br>
Where I was April 29th?<br>
Do I really have to chart the constellations<br>
In his eyes?<br>
You know there&rsquo;s many different ways<br>
That you can kill the one you love<br>
The slowest way is never loving them enough<br>
High infidelity<br>
Put on your records and regret meeting me<br>
I bent the truth too far tonight<br>
I was dancing around dancing around it<br>
High infidelity<br>
Put on your headphones and burn my city<br>
Your picket fence is sharp as knives<br>
I was dancing around dancing around it<br>
Ooh ooh ooh<br>
Woo woo woo<br>
Wooh<br>
Ooh ooh ohh<br>
Woo woo woo<br>
There&rsquo;s many different ways<br>
That you can kill the one you love<br>
It&rsquo;s never enough it&rsquo;s never enough<br>
Lock broken slur spoken<br>
Wound open game token<br>
I didn&rsquo;t know you were keeping count</p>
