<hr>
<p>Baby love I think I&rsquo;ve been a little too kind<br>
Didn&rsquo;t notice you walkin&rsquo; all over<br>
My peace of mind<br>
In the shoes I gave you as a present<br>
Puttin&rsquo; someone first only works<br>
When you&rsquo;re in their top five<br>
And by the way I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out tonight<br>
Best believe I&rsquo;m still bejeweled<br>
When I walk in the room<br>
I can still make the whole place shimmer<br>
And when I meet the band<br>
They ask &lsquo;do you have a man?&rsquo;<br>
I could still say &lsquo;i don&rsquo;t remember&rsquo;<br>
Familiarity breeds contempt<br>
So put me in the basement<br>
When I want the penthouse of your heart<br>
Diamonds in my eyes<br>
I polish up real I polish up real nice<br>
Nice<br>
Baby boy I think I&rsquo;ve been too good of a girl<br>
(Too good of a girl)<br>
Did all the extra credit<br>
Then got graded on a curve<br>
I think it&rsquo;s time to teach some lessons<br>
I made you my world(Huh)<br>
Have you heard?(Huh)<br>
I can reclaim the land<br>
And I miss you(Miss you)<br>
But I miss sparklin&rsquo;(Nice)<br>
Best believe I&rsquo;m still bejeweled<br>
When I walk in the room<br>
I can still make the whole place shimmer<br>
And when I meet the band<br>
They ask &lsquo;do you have a man?&rsquo;<br>
I could still say &lsquo;i don&rsquo;t remember&rsquo;<br>
Familiarity breeds contempt<br>
So put me in the basement<br>
When I want the penthouse of your heart<br>
Diamonds in my eyes<br>
I polish up real I polish up real nice<br>
Nice<br>
Sapphire tears on my face<br>
Sadness became my whole sky<br>
But some guy said my aura&rsquo;s moonstone<br>
Just &lsquo;cause he was high<br>
And we danced all night<br>
And you can try to change my mind<br>
But you might have to wait in line<br>
What&rsquo;s a girl gonna do?<br>
A diamond&rsquo;s gotta shine<br>
Best believe I&rsquo;m still bejeweled<br>
When I walk in the room<br>
I can still make the whole place shimmer<br>
(Shimmer)<br>
And when I meet the band<br>
They ask &lsquo;do you have a man?&rsquo;<br>
I could still say &lsquo;i don&rsquo;t remember&rsquo;<br>
Familiarity breeds contempt<br>
So put me in the basement<br>
When I want the penthouse of your heart<br>
Diamonds in my eyes<br>
I polish up real(Nice) I polish up real nice<br>
And we danced all night<br>
And you can try to change my mind<br>
But you might have to wait in line<br>
What&rsquo;s a girl gonna do? What&rsquo;s a girl gonna do?<br>
I polish up nice<br>
Best believe I&rsquo;m still bejeweled<br>
When I walk in the room<br>
I can still make the whole place shimmer</p>
