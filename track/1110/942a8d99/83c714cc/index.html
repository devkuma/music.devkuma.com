<hr>
<p>I remember<br>
Good girl sad boy<br>
Big city wrong choices<br>
We had one thing goin&rsquo; on<br>
I swear that it was somethin&rsquo;<br>
&lsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t remember who I was<br>
Before you painted all my nights<br>
A color I&rsquo;ve searched for since<br>
But one thing after another<br>
Fuckin&rsquo; situations circumstances<br>
Miscommunications and I<br>
Have to say by the way<br>
I just may like some explanations<br>
Can I ask you a question?<br>
Did you ever have someone kiss you<br>
In a crowded room<br>
And every single<br>
One of your friends was makin&rsquo; fun of you<br>
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin&rsquo; too?<br>
Then what did you do?<br>
Did you leave her house<br>
In the middle of the night? Oh<br>
Did you wish you&rsquo;d put up more of a fight oh<br>
When she said it was too much?<br>
Do you wish you could still touch her?<br>
It&rsquo;s just a question<br>
Half moon eyes bad surprise<br>
Did you realize out of time?<br>
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy<br>
That you saw that night<br>
But you were on somethin&rsquo;<br>
It was one drink after another<br>
Fuckin&rsquo; politics and gender roles<br>
And you&rsquo;re not sure and I don&rsquo;t know<br>
Got swept away in the grey<br>
I just may like to have a conversation<br>
Can I ask you a question?<br>
Did you ever have someone kiss you<br>
In a crowded room<br>
And every single<br>
One of your friends was makin&rsquo; fun of you<br>
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin&rsquo; too?<br>
Then what did you do?<br>
Did you leave her house<br>
In the middle of the night? Oh<br>
Did you wish you&rsquo;d put up more of a fight oh<br>
When she said it was too much?<br>
Do you wish you could still touch her?<br>
It&rsquo;s just a question<br>
Does it feel like everything&rsquo;s just like<br>
Second best after that meteor strike?<br>
And what&rsquo;s that that I heard?<br>
That you&rsquo;re still with her?<br>
That&rsquo;s nice I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s suitable<br>
And right but tonight<br>
Can I ask you a question?<br>
(Can I ask you a question?)<br>
Did you ever have someone kiss you<br>
In a crowded room(In a crowded room)<br>
And every single<br>
One of your friends was makin&rsquo; fun of you<br>
(Makin&rsquo; fun of you)<br>
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin&rsquo; too?<br>
Then what did you do?(Do)<br>
Did you leave her house<br>
In the middle of the night? Oh<br>
Did you wish you&rsquo;d put up more of a fight<br>
Oh(More of a fight)<br>
When she said it was too much?<br>
Do you wish you could still touch her?<br>
It&rsquo;s just a question</p>
