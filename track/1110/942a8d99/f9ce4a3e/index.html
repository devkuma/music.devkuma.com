<hr>
<p>One night a few moons ago<br>
I saw flecks of what could&rsquo;ve been lights<br>
But it might just have been you<br>
Passing by unbeknownst to me<br>
Life is emotionally abusive<br>
And time can&rsquo;t stop me quite like you did<br>
And my flight was awful thanks for asking<br>
I&rsquo;m unglued thanks to you<br>
And it&rsquo;s like snow at the beach<br>
Weird but fucking beautiful<br>
Flying in a dream<br>
Stars by the pocketful<br>
You wanting me<br>
Tonight feels impossible<br>
But it&rsquo;s coming down<br>
No sound it&rsquo;s all around<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow ah<br>
This scene feels like<br>
What I once saw on a screen<br>
I searched &lsquo;aurora borealis green&rsquo;<br>
I&rsquo;ve never seen someone lit from within<br>
Blurring out my periphery<br>
My smile is like I won a contest<br>
And to hide that would be so dishonest<br>
And it&rsquo;s fine to fake it &rsquo;til you make it<br>
&lsquo;Til you do &rsquo;til it&rsquo;s true<br>
Now it&rsquo;s like snow at the beach<br>
Weird but fucking beautiful<br>
Flying in a dream<br>
Stars by the pocketful<br>
You wanting me<br>
Tonight feels impossible<br>
But it&rsquo;s coming down<br>
No sound it&rsquo;s all around<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
Like snow ah<br>
I can&rsquo;t speak afraid to jinx it<br>
I don&rsquo;t even dare to wish it<br>
But your eyes are flying saucers<br>
From another planet<br>
Now I&rsquo;m all for you like Janet<br>
Can this be a real thing? Can it?<br>
Are we falling like snow at the beach?<br>
(Snow at the beach)<br>
Weird but fucking beautiful<br>
Flying in a dream(Flying in a dream)<br>
Stars by the pocketful<br>
You wanting me(You wanting me)<br>
Tonight feels impossible<br>
But it&rsquo;s coming down<br>
No sound it&rsquo;s all around<br>
Like snow on the beach(Snow on the beach)<br>
Like snow on the beach(Snow on the beach)<br>
Like snow on the beach(Snow on the beach)<br>
Like snow ah<br>
It&rsquo;s coming down<br>
No sound it&rsquo;s all around<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
(It&rsquo;s coming down it&rsquo;s coming down)<br>
(It&rsquo;s coming down it&rsquo;s coming down)<br>
Like snow on the beach<br>
(It&rsquo;s coming down it&rsquo;s coming down)<br>
(It&rsquo;s coming down it&rsquo;s coming down)<br>
(It&rsquo;s coming down it&rsquo;s coming down)<br>
(It&rsquo;s coming down it&rsquo;s coming down)<br>
(It&rsquo;s coming down it&rsquo;s coming down)<br>
(It&rsquo;s coming down it&rsquo;s coming down)</p>
