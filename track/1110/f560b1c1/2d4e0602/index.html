    <p>작곡: Joey Bada.., 타블로 / 작사: Joey Bada.., 타블로<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=78478" target="_black">78478</a></p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m from<br>
&lsquo;Han&rsquo; is the name<br>
We gave to struggle<br>
and pain<br>
Its river runs<br>
through our city<br>
Like it runs<br>
through our veins<br>
To us<br>
it&rsquo;s the one thing<br>
Above<br>
all things<br>
Money love<br>
gods and kings<br>
It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s drivin&rsquo; us<br>
be it ahead or insane<br>
We sit shotgun to it<br>
wishin&rsquo;<br>
That it takes us<br>
navigates us<br>
To a better<br>
livin&rsquo;<br>
It&rsquo;s with us<br>
cramped up in the bus<br>
Subways our schools<br>
and our buildings<br>
It&rsquo;s<br>
what our appas pay<br>
To get food<br>
for their children<br>
It sits at the bottom<br>
of the pot<br>
When our ummas<br>
got that<br>
Hot doenjangguk<br>
in the kitchen<br>
On and on<br>
it makes us hustle on<br>
For the money we fight<br>
fall but overcome<br>
That&rsquo;s<br>
why we call it won<br>
Han is spoken<br>
yet unspoken<br>
We could be broke<br>
but never broken<br>
It made my father work<br>
the graveyard shift<br>
And still makes<br>
his graveyard shift<br>
And that&rsquo;s that xhit<br>
right there<br>
What you call &lsquo;soul&rsquo;<br>
is our city right here<br>
From Hongdae<br>
to Bed-Stuy<br>
We&rsquo;re born<br>
from the same pain<br>
Shed alike tears<br>
yeah<br>
Some call it pain<br>
we call it &lsquo;사랑&rsquo; man<br>
Middle finger<br>
to the hate<br>
And the broken minds<br>
that can&rsquo;t relate yeah<br>
And that&rsquo;s that xhit<br>
right there<br>
누가 뭐래도 내 심장에<br>
자리 잡은 도시<br>
날 깨우는 아침의 소리<br>
밤의 빛 right here<br>
Some call it pain<br>
we call it &lsquo;사랑&rsquo; man<br>
Middle finger<br>
to the hate<br>
And the broken minds<br>
that can&rsquo;t relate yeah<br>
Been rap<br>
supreme<br>
Guess it&rsquo;s only right<br>
how I tax a fiend<br>
Been handing out<br>
styles<br>
No that<br>
ain&rsquo;t free<br>
The most adapt<br>
to green without greed<br>
I deserve honors lots<br>
of furs and designers<br>
Tucked under<br>
wet xaginas<br>
In Havana<br>
eating Benihana<br>
While I puff ganja<br>
then forget<br>
All my drama<br>
like I ain&rsquo;t got<br>
No xucking problems<br>
man this SS<br>
Keep piling in<br>
Biggie said it<br>
Mo money<br>
mo headaches<br>
Know he looking down<br>
like oh now you get it<br>
Yes I do<br>
it&rsquo;s best you too<br>
Take the SS from you<br>
then invest in my crew<br>
These chest moves<br>
you couldn&rsquo;t guess<br>
What&rsquo;s next too<br>
I heard the night<br>
Creepin&rsquo; up<br>
with the next moon<br>
Somewhere round<br>
next June<br>
Somewhere we vex too<br>
at the fact<br>
That these raps more<br>
like vegetables to you<br>
But I&rsquo;m livin&rsquo; sweet<br>
I got the juice<br>
Sip slow like<br>
it&rsquo;s lemon tea<br>
With gin too<br>
hot toddy<br>
Served to me<br>
with a nice mami<br>
Look<br>
like Dej Loaf<br>
Catch a body<br>
if ya try me<br>
She so sexy got<br>
a deadly appearance<br>
She dressed up<br>
and killed herself<br>
In the mirror<br>
good lord help me<br>
The massacre<br>
got clearer<br>
Bet she still believe<br>
in ya selfie<br>
See that&rsquo;s that xhit<br>
right there<br>
Another J blown in<br>
the mist right there<br>
A sunny day won&rsquo;t make<br>
this pic clear<br>
For all the dead<br>
and gone<br>
Put a spliff<br>
in the air<br>
This one for the pain<br>
this one for the hate<br>
Middle finger<br>
to the lames<br>
And you broke xss<br>
xiggas<br>
That can&rsquo;t<br>
relate<br>
See that&rsquo;s that xhit<br>
right there<br>
Another J blown in<br>
the mist right there<br>
A sunny day won&rsquo;t make<br>
this pic clear<br>
For all the dead<br>
and gone<br>
Put a spliff<br>
in the air<br>
This one for the pain<br>
this one for the hate<br>
Middle finger<br>
to the lames<br>
And you broke ass<br>
xiggas<br>
That can&rsquo;t<br>
relate<br>
Good lord<br>
help me<br>
힘겹지만<br>
곧 행복이 되겠지<br>
Good lord<br>
help me<br>
두렵지만<br>
곧 행복이 되겠지<br>
See that&rsquo;s that xhit<br>

And that&rsquo;s that xhit<br>
right there<br>
What you call &lsquo;Soul&rsquo;<br>
is our city right here<br>
From Hongdae<br>
to Bed-Stuy<br>
We&rsquo;re born<br>
from the same pain<br>
Shed alike tears<br>
yeah<br>
Some call it pain<br>
we call it &lsquo;사랑&rsquo; man<br>
Middle finger<br>
to the hate<br>
And the broken minds<br>
that can&rsquo;t relate<br>
