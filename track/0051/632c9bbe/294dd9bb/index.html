<p>I was told<br>
a million times<br>
Of all the troubles<br>
in my way<br>
Mind you grow<br>
a little wiser<br>
Little better<br>
every day<br>
But if I crossed<br>
a million rivers<br>
And I rode<br>
a million miles<br>
Then I&rsquo;d still be<br>
where I started<br>
Bread and butter<br>
for a smile<br>
Well I sold<br>
a million mirrors<br>
In a shop<br>
in Alley Way<br>
But I never saw<br>
my face<br>
In any window<br>
any day<br>
Now they say<br>
your folks are<br>
Telling you<br>
be a superstar<br>
But I tell you<br>
just be satisfied<br>
Stay right<br>
where you are<br>
Keep yourself alive<br>
keep yourself alive<br>
It&rsquo;ll take you<br>
all your time<br>
And a money<br>
honey you&rsquo;ll survive</p>
<p>Well I&rsquo;ve loved<br>
a million women<br>
In a belladonnic<br>
haze<br>
And I ate<br>
a million dinners<br>
Brought to me<br>
on silver trays<br>
Give me<br>
everything I need<br>
To feed my body<br>
and my soul<br>
Well I&rsquo;ll grow<br>
a little bigger<br>
Maybe<br>
that can be my goal<br>
I was told<br>
a million times<br>
Of all the people<br>
in my way<br>
How I had<br>
to keep on trying<br>
And get better<br>
every day<br>
But if I crossed<br>
a million rivers<br>
And I rode<br>
a million miles<br>
Then I&rsquo;d still be<br>
where I started<br>
Same as<br>
when I started<br>
Keep yourself alive<br>
keep yourself alive<br>
It&rsquo;ll take you<br>
all your time<br>
And a money<br>
honey<br>
You&rsquo;ll survive<br>
shake</p>
<p>Keep yourself alive<br>
keep yourself alive<br>
It&rsquo;ll take you<br>
all your time<br>
And a money<br>
to keep me satisfied<br>
Do you think you&rsquo;re<br>
better every day<br>
No I just think<br>
I&rsquo;m two steps<br>
Nearer<br>
to my grave<br>
Keep yourself alive<br>
keep yourself alive<br>
You take your time<br>
and take more money<br>
Keep yourself<br>
alive<br>
Keep yourself alive<br>
keep yourself alive<br>
All you people<br>
keep yourself alive<br>
Keep yourself alive<br>
keep yourself alive<br>
It&rsquo;ll take you<br>
all your time<br>
And a money<br>
to keep me satisfied<br>
Keep yourself alive<br>
keep yourself alive<br>
All you people<br>
keep yourself alive<br>
Take you all your time<br>
and money<br>
Honey<br>
you will survive<br>
Keep you satisfied<br>
keep you satisfied</p>
