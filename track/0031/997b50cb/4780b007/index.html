Pockets<br>

And what I got<br>
in my advance&rsquo;d<br>
Make yo&rsquo; stomach<br>

I keep a strap up<br>
on my waist<br>
It got a hollow<br>

Got one<br>

And the other<br>

You get tased<br>

After talkin&rsquo;<br>

Leave a red dot beam<br>

And my money<br>

Where your bands go<br>

And I&rsquo;ll catch<br>

Tell me<br>

&lsquo;Til they pickin&rsquo;<br>
the right side<br>
The cyanide in yo&rsquo;<br>
drink go bye-bye<br>
Make plays get bank<br>
for my own time<br>
Stay away<br>
from the motherfxxxxxx<br>
Tryna<br>

To take a blade<br>
to my name<br>

Revenge on my chest<br>
