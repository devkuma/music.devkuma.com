  Eminem - 8 Mile - Music
  </title>
  <meta name="description" content="Its ok its ok Youre gonna make it anyway Sometimes I just feel like quittin I still might Why do I put up this fight why do I still write sometimes its hard Enough just dealin with real life Sometimes I wanna jump this stage And just kill mics and show these people What my level of skills like but Im still white sometimes I just hate life Somethin aint right hit the brake lights Case of this stage fright Drawin a blank like Oh it aint my fault breakin eyeballs My insides crawl And I clam up I just slam shut I just cant do it my whole manhoods Just been stripped Ive just been ripped So I must didnt get for the bust didnt Split man fuck this shit yo Im goin the fuck home World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 mile road Im a man Im a make a new plan Time for me to just stand up And travel new land time for me to Just take matters into my own hands Once Im over these tracks man Im a never look back And Im gone I know right where Im goin sorry mama Im grown I must travel alone aint gon follow No footsteps Im makin my own Only way that I know how to escape From this 8 mile road Walkin these train tracks Tryin to regain back the spirit I had fore I go back to the same crap To the same plant in the same pants Trynna chase rap gotta move asap Get a new plan mamas got a new man Poor little baby sister She dont understand Sits in front of the TV Buries her nose in her pad And just colors until the crayon Gets dull on her hand While she colors her big brother Her mother and dad Aint no tellin what really goes on In her little head Wish I could be the daddy That neither one of us had But I keep runnin from something I never wanted so bad Sometimes I get upset cause I aint blew up yet Its like I grew up But I aint grown me too Nuts yet dont gotta rep my step Dont got enough pep the pressures Too much man Im just trynna Do whats best and I try sit alone And I cry yo I wont tell No lie not a moment goes by That I dont pray to the sky Please Im beggin you God Please dont let me pidgeonholed in No regular job yo I hope you can Hear me homie wherever you are Yo Im tellin you God Im bailin this trailor Tomorrow tell my mother I love her kiss baby sister goodbye So whenever you need me Baby Im never too far But yo I gotta get out there the Only way I know and Im a be back For you the second that I blow On everything I own Ill make it On my own off to work I go back to this 8 mile road Im a man Im a make a new plan Time for me to just stand up And travel new land time for me to Just take matters into my own hands Once Im over these tracks man Im a never look back And Im gone I know right where Im goin sorry mama Im grown I must travel alone aint gon follow No footsteps Im makin my own Only way that I know how to escape From this 8 mile road You gotta live it to feel it You didnt you wouldnt get it Well see what the big deal is Why it wasnt it still is to be Walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits Its different its a certain Significance of certificate Of authenticity youd never even see But its everything to me Its my credibility youd never seen Heard smelled or met a real MC whose Incredible or on the same pedastal as me But yet Im still unsigned havin a Rough time sit on the porch with All my friends and kick dumb rhymes Go to work and serve MCs in the lunch line But when it comes crunch time where do My punch lines go who must I show to bust my flow where must I go who must I know Or am I just another crab in the bucket Cause I aint havin no luck With this little rabbit so fuck it Maybe I need a new outlet Im startin to doubt shit Im feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with I look like a bum Yo my clothes aint about shit At the salvation army trynna Salvage an outfit and its cold trynna Travel this road plus I feel like Im always stuck in this battlin mode My defenses are so up but One thing I dont want is pity From no one this city is no fun There is no sun and its so dark sometimes I feel like Im just bein Pulled apart from each one Of my limbs by each one of my friends Its enough to just make me wanna jump Outta my skin sometimes I feel like a robot Sometimes I just know not What Im doin I just blow my head Is a stove top I just explode the ghetto gets So hot sometimes my mouth just Overloads the acid I dont got But Ive learned its time for me To Uturn yo it only takes one time For me to get burned aint no fallin Or next time Im meet a new girl I can no longer play stupid or be immature I got every ingredient all I need is the courage like I already got the beat all I need is the words Got the urge suddenly its a surge Suddenly a new burst of energy Has occurred time to show These free world leaders a three And a third I am no longer scared now Im free as a bird then I turn and cross Over the median curve Hit the burbs and all you See is a blur of 8 mile road Im a man Im a make a new plan Time for me to just stand up And travel new land time for me to Just take matters into my own hands Once Im over these tracks Man Im a never look back And Im gone I know right where Im goin sorry mama Im grown I must travel alone aint gon follow No footsteps Im makin

<p>It&rsquo;s ok<br>
it&rsquo;s ok<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna<br>
make it anyway<br>
Sometimes I just feel<br>
like quittin<br>
I still<br>
might<br>
Why do I put up this<br>
fight why do<br>
I still write<br>
sometimes its hard<br>
Enough just dealin&rsquo;<br>
with real life<br>
Sometimes I wanna<br>
jump this stage<br>
And just kill mics<br>
and show these people<br>
What my level of<br>
skills like but<br>
I&rsquo;m still white<br>
sometimes<br>
I just<br>
hate life<br>
Somethin&rsquo; aint right<br>
hit the brake lights<br>
Case of this<br>
stage fright<br>
Drawin&rsquo; a<br>
blank like<br>
Oh it ain&rsquo;t my fault<br>
breakin&rsquo; eyeballs<br>
My insides<br>
crawl<br>
And I clam up<br>
I just slam shut<br>
I just can&rsquo;t do it<br>
my whole manhood&rsquo;s<br>
Just been stripped<br>
I&rsquo;ve just been ripped<br>
So I must didn&rsquo;t get<br>
for the bust didn&rsquo;t<br>
Split man fuck this<br>
shit yo<br>
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;<br>
the fuck home<br>
World on my shoulders<br>
as I run back to this<br>
8 mile<br>
road<br>
I&rsquo;m a man<br>
I&rsquo;m a make a new plan<br>
Time for me to<br>
just stand up<br>
And travel new land<br>
time for me to<br>
Just take matters<br>
into my own hands<br>
Once I&rsquo;m over these<br>
tracks man<br>
I&rsquo;m a never<br>
look back<br>
And I&rsquo;m gone<br>
I know right where<br>
I&rsquo;m goin sorry mama<br>
I&rsquo;m grown<br>
I must travel alone<br>
ain&rsquo;t gon&rsquo; follow<br>
No footsteps<br>
I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; my own<br>
Only way that<br>
I know how to escape<br>
From this<br>
8 mile road<br>
Walkin&rsquo; these<br>
train tracks<br>
Tryin&rsquo; to regain<br>
back the spirit<br>
I had &lsquo;fore I go back<br>
to the same crap<br>
To the same plant<br>
in the same pants<br>
Trynna chase rap<br>
gotta move asap<br>
Get a new plan<br>
mama&rsquo;s got a new man<br>
Poor little<br>
baby sister<br>
She don&rsquo;t<br>
understand<br>
Sits in front<br>
of the TV<br>
Buries her nose<br>
in her pad<br>
And just colors until<br>
the crayon<br>
Gets dull<br>
on her hand<br>
While she colors<br>
her big brother<br>
Her mother<br>
and dad<br>
Ain&rsquo;t no tellin&rsquo;<br>
what really goes on<br>
In her<br>
little head<br>
Wish I could<br>
be the daddy<br>
That neither<br>
one of us had<br>
But I keep runnin&rsquo;<br>
from something<br>
I never<br>
wanted so bad<br>
Sometimes<br>
I get upset cause<br>
I ain&rsquo;t<br>
blew up yet<br>
It&rsquo;s like<br>
I grew up<br>
But I ain&rsquo;t<br>
grown me too<br>
Nuts yet don&rsquo;t gotta<br>
rep my step<br>
Don&rsquo;t got enough<br>
pep the pressure&rsquo;s<br>
Too much man<br>
I&rsquo;m just trynna<br>
Do what&rsquo;s best<br>
and I try sit alone<br>
And I cry yo<br>
I won&rsquo;t tell<br>
No lie not a<br>
moment goes by<br>
That I don&rsquo;t<br>
pray to the sky<br>
Please<br>
I&rsquo;m beggin&rsquo; you God<br>
Please don&rsquo;t let me<br>
pidgeon-holed in<br>
No regular job<br>
yo I hope you can<br>
Hear me homie<br>
wherever you are<br>
Yo I&rsquo;m<br>
tellin&rsquo; you<br>
God I&rsquo;m bailin&rsquo;<br>
this trailor<br>
Tomorrow tell<br>
my mother<br>
I love her kiss baby<br>
sister good-bye<br>
So whenever<br>
you need me<br>
Baby I&rsquo;m never<br>
too far<br>
But yo I gotta get<br>
out there the<br>
Only way I know<br>
and I&rsquo;m a be back<br>
For you the<br>
second that I blow<br>
On everything<br>
I own I&rsquo;ll make it<br>
On my own off to work<br>
I go back to this<br>
8 mile<br>
road<br>
I&rsquo;m a man<br>
I&rsquo;m a make a new plan<br>
Time for me to<br>
just stand up<br>
And travel new land<br>
time for me to<br>
Just take matters<br>
into my own hands<br>
Once I&rsquo;m over<br>
these tracks man<br>
I&rsquo;m a never<br>
look back<br>
And I&rsquo;m gone<br>
I know right where<br>
I&rsquo;m goin sorry<br>
mama I&rsquo;m grown<br>
I must travel alone<br>
ain&rsquo;t gon&rsquo; follow<br>
No footsteps<br>
I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; my own<br>
Only way that<br>
I know how to escape<br>
From this<br>
8 mile road<br>
You gotta live it<br>
to feel it<br>
You didn&rsquo;t<br>
you wouldn&rsquo;t get it<br>
We&rsquo;ll see what the<br>
big deal is<br>
Why it wasn&rsquo;t it<br>
still is to be<br>
Walkin&rsquo; this<br>
borderline of<br>
Detroit city<br>
limits<br>
Its different<br>
it&rsquo;s a certain<br>
Significance<br>
of certificate<br>
Of authenticity<br>
you&rsquo;d never even see<br>
But its<br>
everything to me<br>
Its my credibility<br>
you&rsquo;d never seen<br>
Heard smelled or<br>
met a real MC whose<br>
Incredible or on the<br>
same pedastal as me<br>
But yet I&rsquo;m still<br>
un-signed havin&rsquo; a<br>
Rough time sit on the<br>
porch with<br>
All my friends<br>
and kick dumb rhymes<br>
Go to work<br>
and serve<br>
MC&rsquo;s in the<br>
lunch line<br>
But when it comes<br>
crunch time where do<br>
My punch lines go<br>
who must<br>
I show to bust<br>
my flow where must<br>
I go who must<br>
I know<br>
Or am I just another<br>
crab in the bucket<br>
Cause I ain&rsquo;t<br>
havin&rsquo; no luck<br>
With this little<br>
rabbit so fuck it<br>
Maybe I need a new<br>
outlet<br>
I&rsquo;m startin&rsquo;<br>
to doubt shit<br>
I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; a little<br>
skeptical who<br>
I hang out with<br>
I look like a bum<br>
Yo my clothes<br>
ain&rsquo;t about shit<br>
At the salvation<br>
army trynna<br>
Salvage an outfit<br>
and its cold trynna<br>
Travel this road plus<br>
I feel like<br>
I&rsquo;m always stuck<br>
in this battlin&rsquo; mode<br>
My defenses<br>
are so up but<br>
One thing<br>
I don&rsquo;t want is pity<br>
From no one<br>
this city is no fun<br>
There is no sun and<br>
its so dark sometimes<br>
I feel like<br>
I&rsquo;m just bein&rsquo;<br>
Pulled apart<br>
from each one<br>
Of my limbs by each<br>
one of my friends<br>
Its enough to just<br>
make me wanna jump<br>
Outta my skin<br>
sometimes<br>
I feel<br>
like a robot<br>
Sometimes<br>
I just know not<br>
What I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo;<br>
I just blow my head<br>
Is a<br>
stove top<br>
I just explode<br>
the ghetto gets<br>
So hot sometimes<br>
my mouth just<br>
Overloads the<br>
acid I don&rsquo;t got<br>
But I&rsquo;ve learned<br>
its time for me<br>
To U-turn yo it<br>
only takes one time<br>
For me to get burned<br>
ain&rsquo;t no fallin&rsquo;<br>
Or next time<br>
I&rsquo;m meet a new girl<br>
I can no longer play<br>
stupid or be immature<br>
I got every<br>
ingredient all<br>
I need is the<br>
courage like<br>
I already got the<br>
beat all<br>
I need is<br>
the words<br>
Got the urge<br>
suddenly it&rsquo;s a surge<br>
Suddenly a new<br>
burst of energy<br>
Has occurred<br>
time to show<br>
These free world<br>
leaders a three<br>
And a third I am<br>
no longer scared now<br>
I&rsquo;m free as a bird<br>
then I turn and cross<br>
Over the<br>
median curve<br>
Hit the burbs<br>
and all you<br>
See is a blur of<br>
8 mile road<br>
I&rsquo;m a man<br>
I&rsquo;m a make a new plan<br>
Time for me to<br>
just stand up<br>
And travel new land<br>
time for me to<br>
Just take matters<br>
into my own hands<br>
Once I&rsquo;m over<br>
these tracks<br>
Man I&rsquo;m a<br>
never look back<br>
And I&rsquo;m gone<br>
I know right where<br>
I&rsquo;m goin sorry mama<br>
I&rsquo;m grown<br>
I must travel alone<br>
ain&rsquo;t gon&rsquo; follow<br>
No footsteps<br>
I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; my own<br>
Only way that<br>
I know how to escape<br>
From this<br>
8 mile road</p>
