    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=60307" target="_black">60307</a></p>
<p>Yeah I know sometimes<br>
things may not always<br>
Make sense to<br>
you right now<br>
But hey what daddy<br>
always tell you?<br>
Straighten up<br>
little soldier<br>
Stiffen up<br>
that upper lip<br>
What you cryin about?<br>
You got me<br>
Hailie I know you<br>
miss your mom and I<br>
Know you<br>
miss your dad<br>
When I&rsquo;m gone<br>
but I&rsquo;m tryin to<br>
Give you the life<br>
that I never had<br>
I can see you&rsquo;re<br>
sad even when you<br>
Smile even<br>
when you laugh<br>
I can see it<br>
in your eyes<br>
Deep inside<br>
you wanna cry<br>
Cause you&rsquo;re scared<br>
I ain&rsquo;t there<br>
Daddy&rsquo;s with you<br>
in your prayers<br>
No more cryin<br>
wipe them tears<br>
Daddy&rsquo;s here<br>
no more nightmares<br>
We gon&rsquo;<br>
pull together<br>
Through it<br>
we gon&rsquo; do it<br>
Laney Uncle&rsquo;s<br>
crazy ain&rsquo;t he yeah<br>
But he loves you girl<br>
and you better know it<br>
We&rsquo;re all we<br>
got it this world<br>
When it spins<br>
when it swirls<br>
When it whirls<br>
when it twirls<br>
Two little<br>
beautiful girls<br>
Lookin puzzled<br>
in a daze<br>
I know it&rsquo;s<br>
confusin you<br>
Daddy&rsquo;s always<br>
on the move<br>
Mama&rsquo;s always<br>
on the news<br>
I try to keep up<br>
sheltered from it<br>
But somehow<br>
it seems<br>
The harder that<br>
I try to do that<br>
The more it<br>
backfires on me<br>
All the things<br>
growin up as<br>
Daddy that<br>
he had to see<br>
Daddy don&rsquo;t<br>
want you to see<br>
But you see just<br>
as much as he did<br>
We did not<br>
plan it to be<br>
This way your<br>
mother and me<br>
But things have<br>
got so bad<br>
Between us I don&rsquo;t<br>
see us ever bein<br>
Together ever<br>
again like we used<br>
To be when we<br>
was teenagers<br>
But then of<br>
course everything<br>
Always happens<br>
for a reason<br>
I guess it was<br>
never meant to be<br>
But it&rsquo;s just<br>
somethin that<br>
We have<br>
no control over<br>
And that&rsquo;s<br>
what destiny is<br>
But no more<br>
worries rest<br>
Your head<br>
and go to sleep<br>
Maybe one day we&rsquo;ll<br>
wake up and<br>
This&rsquo;ll all<br>
just be a dream<br>
Now hush little<br>
baby don&rsquo;t you cry<br>
Everything&rsquo;s<br>
gonna be alright<br>
Stiffen that<br>
upper lip up<br>
Little lady<br>
I told ya<br>
Daddy&rsquo;s here to hold<br>
ya through the night<br>
I know mommy&rsquo;s<br>
not here right now<br>
And we<br>
don&rsquo;t know why<br>
We feel how<br>
we feel inside<br>
It may seem a little<br>
crazy pretty baby<br>
But I promise momma&rsquo;s<br>
gon&rsquo; be alright<br>
Heh it&rsquo;s<br>
funny<br>
I remember back<br>
one year when<br>
Daddy had no money<br>
mommy wrapped the<br>
Christmas<br>
presents up and<br>
Stuck &rsquo;em<br>
under the tree<br>
And said some of<br>
&rsquo;em weren&rsquo;t from me<br>
Cause daddy<br>
couldn&rsquo;t buy &rsquo;em<br>
I&rsquo;ll never forget that<br>
Christmas<br>
I sat up the<br>
whole night cryin<br>
Cause daddy<br>
felt like a bum<br>
See daddy<br>
had a job<br>
But his job was<br>
to keep the food<br>
On the table<br>
for you and mom<br>
And at the time every<br>
house that we lived in<br>
Either kept gettin<br>
broken into and<br>
Robbed or shot up<br>
on the block<br>
And your mom<br>
was savin money<br>
For you in a jar<br>
tryin to start a<br>
Piggy bank for<br>
you so you could<br>
Go to college<br>
almost had a<br>
Thousand dollars<br>
&rsquo;til someone<br>
Broke in<br>
and stole it<br>
And I know it<br>
hurt so bad it<br>
Broke your<br>
momma&rsquo;s heart<br>
And it seemed<br>
like everything was<br>
Just startin to<br>
fall apart<br>
Mom and dad was<br>
arguin a lot<br>
So momma<br>
moved back<br>
On the Chalmers<br>
in the flat one<br>
Bedroom apartment<br>
and dad moved<br>
Back to the other side<br>
of 8 Mile on Novara<br>
And that&rsquo;s<br>
when daddy went to<br>
California<br>
with his CD<br>
And met Dr. Dre<br>
and flew you<br>
And momma<br>
out to see me<br>
But daddy had to<br>
work you and<br>
Momma had to<br>
leave me<br>
Then you started seein<br>
daddy on the TV<br>
And momma didn&rsquo;t<br>
like it and you<br>
And Laney were too<br>
young to understand it<br>
Papa was a<br>
rollin stone<br>
Momma developed<br>
a habit<br>
And it all<br>
happened too<br>
Fast for either<br>
one of us to grab it<br>
I&rsquo;m just sorry<br>
you were there and<br>
Had to witness<br>
it first hand<br>
Cause all I<br>
ever wanted<br>
To do was just<br>
make you proud<br>
Now I&rsquo;m sittin<br>
in this empty house<br>
Just reminiscin<br>
lookin at your baby<br>
Pictures it<br>
just trips me out<br>
To see how much you<br>
both have grown<br>
It&rsquo;s almost like<br>
you&rsquo;re sisters now<br>
Wow guess you<br>
pretty much are<br>
And daddy&rsquo;s<br>
still here<br>
Laney I&rsquo;m talkin<br>
to you too<br>
Daddy&rsquo;s still here<br>
I like the sound of<br>
That yeah it&rsquo;s got a<br>
ring to it don&rsquo;t it?<br>
Shh momma&rsquo;s only<br>
gone for the moment<br>
Now hush little<br>
baby don&rsquo;t you cry<br>
Everything&rsquo;s<br>
gonna be alright<br>
Stiffen that<br>
upper lip up<br>
Little lady<br>
I told ya<br>
Daddy&rsquo;s here to hold<br>
ya through the night<br>
I know mommy&rsquo;s<br>
not here right now<br>
And we don&rsquo;t<br>
know why<br>
We feel how<br>
we feel inside<br>
It may seem a little<br>
crazy pretty baby<br>
But I promise momma&rsquo;s<br>
gon&rsquo; be alright<br>
And if you ask me to<br>
daddy&rsquo;s gonna<br>
Buy you<br>
a mockingbird<br>
I&rsquo;m a give you<br>
the world<br>
I&rsquo;m a buy a<br>
diamond ring<br>
For you<br>
I&rsquo;m a sing for you<br>
I&rsquo;ll do anything for<br>
you to see you smile<br>
And if that<br>
mockingbird<br>
Don&rsquo;t sing and that<br>
ring don&rsquo;t shine<br>
I&rsquo;m a break that<br>
birdie&rsquo;s neck<br>
I&rsquo;d go back to the<br>
jeweler who<br>
Sold it to ya<br>
and make him eat<br>
Every carat don&rsquo;t fuck<br>
with dad Ha ha!</p>
