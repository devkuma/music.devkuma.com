    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79452" target="_black">79452</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m liable to start<br>
a violent spark<br>
With a silent<br>
thought<br>
I disgust you<br>
like dialogue<br>
From the shop<br>
to the wired frog<br>
Night club xhit<br>
I was taught<br>
If your CD&rsquo;s<br>
on fire<br>
You had to put it out<br>
yourself<br>
Like Highland Park<br>
no fire department<br>
So you might not hear<br>
sirens at all<br>
But don&rsquo;t be alarmed<br>
if I sound off<br>
Something just ain&rsquo;t<br>
right with me dawg<br>
A martyr<br>
on a private charter<br>
Whose life<br>
could be harder<br>
Widely regarded highly<br>
bite me sweetheart<br>
I&rsquo;m slightly<br>
xetarded<br>
But tonight<br>
I&rsquo;m starting xhit<br>
I&rsquo;m feeling<br>
self righteous<br>
I might just hop<br>
in a mosh pit on some<br>
Mike Tyson<br>
and Pac xhit<br>
Looking to box<br>
with anybody<br>
Disorderly<br>
conduct<br>
I&rsquo;ll xuck around<br>
and snort a key<br>
And pick a fight<br>
with a locksmith<br>
Fan of the LOX<br>
bananas manic<br>
I&rsquo;m going in shock<br>
frantic<br>
I&rsquo;m trapped<br>
in a closet<br>
Panic attack<br>
&lsquo;cause<br>
I&rsquo;m claustrophobic<br>
no xaggot I mean<br>
I can&rsquo;t maneuver<br>
from movement<br>
&lsquo;Cause I have no room<br>
for improvement<br>
I&rsquo;m practically<br>
squashed<br>
Unpacked it<br>
and boxed it<br>
Toxic<br>
hands are arsenic<br>
Flammable bars<br>
examine the content<br>
Bar exam<br>
start of insanity<br>
Charles Hamilton slash<br>
Manson and Bronson<br>
Animal snarls<br>
cannibal jaws<br>
Shark mandibles<br>
lambs to the slaughter<br>
Looking scamp<br>
as Hannibal stalking<br>
Anthony Hopkins<br>
with his hands<br>
In his pockets<br>
black out<br>
Zach Galifianakis<br>
gallons of vodka<br>
But that gal has<br>
some knockers<br>
I bet you<br>
they ring a bell<br>
When I come back<br>
and I&rsquo;m conscious<br>
What happened doc<br>
I passed out again<br>
Alcohol&rsquo;s making me<br>
break into<br>
Vacant&rsquo;s naked stole<br>
a magnum box and bag<br>
Cirocs<br>
in back of a Datsun<br>
Fell asleep<br>
watching<br>
Fear factor<br>
and scare tactics<br>
Too close<br>
to the StairMaster<br>
Poked a hole<br>
in the air<br>
Mattress and popped it<br>
woke up shortly<br>
Thereafter hungover<br>
no underwear grasping<br>
A Bayer Aspirin<br>
and dropped it<br>
Air Max in my closet<br>
preposterous<br>
Nikes<br>
made out of ostrich<br>
And the cross<br>
stitching is<br>
A cross mixing<br>
of a rhinoceros<br>
Possum skin<br>
giraffe and a dolphin<br>
Fin cotton Dockers<br>
OshKoshes<br>
Drop crotches<br>
Swatch watches<br>
And sneakers matches<br>
with the Parkers<br>
But it&rsquo;s like being<br>
overstaffed<br>
At a boxing gym with<br>
all these trainers<br>
But I don&rsquo;t have<br>
any boxers<br>
And I&rsquo;m standing here<br>
naked<br>
Hangover still wasted<br>
like paper<br>
You write raps<br>
on obnoxious<br>
Yo why does it<br>
always sound<br>
Like I&rsquo;m grabbing<br>
my nostrils<br>
Xuck that<br>
I&rsquo;ll battle &rsquo;em all<br>
I&rsquo;ll battle a mall<br>
I&rsquo;ll stand there<br>
And yell that<br>
at a wall<br>
Until the<br>
mannequin doll<br>
Scatter and<br>
the inanimate objects<br>
That I&rsquo;m battering<br>
all shatter and fall<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
I hear the track<br>
And I&rsquo;m starting to<br>
get xucking amped<br>
I&rsquo;ma spark plug<br>
I&rsquo;m like the car<br>
With the cables<br>
hooked up<br>
To my xucking back<br>
I&rsquo;m a Duracell<br>
But I sure as hell<br>
got it backwards<br>
&lsquo;Cause y&rsquo;all could<br>
get jumped<br>
And I&rsquo;d catch<br>
the battery charge<br>
But I got a hunch<br>
like your back<br>
When it&rsquo;s arching<br>
when I start attacking<br>
Your squadron<br>
you&rsquo;ll feel like<br>
MasterCard<br>
when I&rsquo;m charging<br>
So take<br>
a swipe at me<br>
I&rsquo;m coming<br>
straight at you<br>
Like<br>
Clay Matthews<br>
From the<br>
Green Bay Packers<br>
So get the<br>
sack of Wisconsin<br>
That&rsquo;s nutbag<br>
that I&rsquo;m talking<br>
Who am I<br>
kidding<br>
You xaggots are all<br>
gonna do my bidding<br>
Don&rsquo;t get dragged<br>
to the auction<br>
Neiman Marcus bags of<br>
Vuitton and all<br>
I&rsquo;ll push a xitch<br>
into oncoming traffic<br>
Just watch this<br>
stretched tinted<br>
Black sedan my xss<br>
see how mad you act<br>
When I drop you off<br>
at Saks Fifth Ave<br>
In a xucking taxi cab<br>
to go shopping<br>
Affable guy next<br>
door is laughable<br>
My next whore&rsquo;s gonna<br>
have mechanical arms<br>
That&rsquo;ll<br>
jack me off<br>
With a lotion<br>
dispenser<br>
With a motion sensor<br>
no emotion<br>
Hence I guess this<br>
sick prick dies hard<br>
I got a Magic Johnson<br>
it&rsquo;s like a magic wand<br>
Allows me to not<br>
let a blonde arouse me<br>
If Ronda Rousey was<br>
on the couch<br>
With the condoms out<br>
holding a thousand<br>
Magnums at once<br>
to pounce me<br>
I&rsquo;ll laugh<br>
in response to<br>
How she dances and<br>
flaunts it around me<br>
Her flat little<br>
xadonkadonk is<br>
Bouncing around<br>
and all I see is<br>
Paulie Malign<br>
now<br>
She&rsquo;s slaughterhouse<br>
in a blouse<br>
And Madonna<br>
with mud on her<br>
Xoddammit<br>
I am misogynist<br>
I slap Linda Ronstadt<br>
with a lobster<br>
Throw her off<br>
a balcony<br>
Just so happens<br>
she&rsquo;s fond of algae<br>
&lsquo;Cause now<br>
she&rsquo;s faceplants<br>
On the concrete<br>
complete<br>
Lack of<br>
responsibility<br>
Half you xssholes<br>
ain&rsquo;t strong enough<br>
To pick up a spirit<br>
xhit<br>
You xags couldn&rsquo;t<br>
shoplift<br>
At a thrift<br>
shop<br>
But I let the track<br>
lift &rsquo;em up<br>
Boost the energy<br>
klepto<br>
I&rsquo;m back to rip<br>
shop up<br>
But my thing is<br>
this now<br>
Five-finger discount<br>
been rapping so long<br>
I&rsquo;ve been killing<br>
this xhit<br>
It&rsquo;s easy<br>
kidnapping your mom<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m still<br>
in this xitch thievery<br>
Ransom for JonBenet<br>
Ramsey Chandra<br>
Levy and Gary Condit<br>
Paul was scared<br>
That if I went<br>
back to the blonde<br>
I might relapse<br>
get on some bullxhit<br>
Perhaps I&rsquo;ll launch<br>
some cracker<br>
Taunts at action<br>
Bronson Macklemore<br>
Mac Miller<br>
and Asher Roth<br>
And have some back<br>
and forths<br>
And record a wack<br>
response to<br>
Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s<br>
control verse<br>
And perform fack<br>
in concert<br>
(Yo<br>
I put that xhit<br>
On a greatest hits<br>
album)<br>
Now<br>
that was awesome<br>
It takes some massive<br>
balls to<br>
Do some xhit<br>
like that<br>
Sometimes<br>
I have to ponder<br>
Why people are like<br>
(I&rsquo;ll stick around)<br>
And put up with<br>
my crap so long for<br>
What&rsquo;s the attraction<br>
mama<br>
Is it the fact that<br>
I&rsquo;m a walking talking<br>
Actual quadruple<br>
entendre<br>
Or the<br>
pointy nose<br>
That&rsquo;s pointing<br>
at you mama<br>
Who knows<br>
at this point<br>
It&rsquo;s always<br>
poking so meh<br>
Still get along<br>
with this voice<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
that&rsquo;s the monster<br>
So do-si-do<br>
with a sociopath<br>
Everyone who knows me<br>
knows that<br>
What they don&rsquo;t know<br>
is the fact<br>
Rihanna calls me<br>
Pinocchio meh<br>
She loves the way<br>
I lie<br>
Sits on my face<br>
and waits<br>
For my nose to grow<br>
pathological liar<br>
Oh why am I<br>
such an xsshole<br>
That<br>
my disguise is pants<br>
But they on fire<br>
so am I<br>
Cappadonna<br>
cut the track off<br>
Sabotage Christmas<br>
crap in your stocking<br>
I&rsquo;m wrapping up<br>
all the presents<br>
In xucking<br>
camouflage<br>
So you can&rsquo;t even<br>
find &rsquo;em<br>
Jack Santa Claus snap<br>
Rudolph&rsquo;s antlers off<br>
Wrap his schnoz<br>
in gauze bandage<br>
And blind him<br>
blowing the head<br>
Gasket at bed<br>
bath and beyond<br>
Put the basket back<br>
while the bath salt<br>
Packets are<br>
gone I<br>
Know you really<br>
tired of me<br>
Sampling Billy Squier<br>
but classic rock<br>
Acid rap is the genre<br>
got slash on guitar<br>
Splashing bizarre<br>
thrasher and Aerosmith<br>
And I&rsquo;m a spectacular<br>
archer<br>
Feed count<br>
Dracula Chocula<br>
Godzilla half dragon<br>
and Bob Dylan<br>
Bandwagoners<br>
I&rsquo;m kicking the xamn<br>
Stragglers off<br>
and I&rsquo;m strangling &rsquo;em<br>
Smack Kim Basinger<br>
on a xss</p>
