  <meta name="description" content="Im beginning to feel like a rap God rap God All my people from the front to the Back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long Enough to slap box slap box They said I rap like a robot So call me rapbot But for me to rap like a computer Must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My penll go off when I halfcock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a living and a killing off it Ever since Bill Clinton was Still in office with Monica Lewinsky Feeling on his nutsack Im an MC still as honest But as rude and indecent As all hell syllables killaholic Kill em all with This slickety gibbedy hibbedy hip hop You dont really wanna Get into a pissing match With this rappidy rap Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac Pack backpack rap yep yacketyyak The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts While Im practicing That Ill still be able to Break a motherxuckin table Over the back of a couple of xaggots And crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to aftermath After the fact how could I not blow All I do is drop Fbombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period Heres a maxipad Its actually disastrously bad For the wack while Im masterfully Constructing this masterpiece as Im beginning to feel like a rap God rap God All my people from the front to the Back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long Enough to slap box slap box Let me show you maintaining This shit aint that hard that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap Immortality like I have got Well to be truthful the blueprints Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the moon since MCs get taken to school with this music Cause I use it As a vehicle to bust a rhyme Now I lead a new school Full of students me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz 2Pac NWA Cube Hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy Thank you they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet Run DMC and induct them Into the motherxuckin Rock n roll Hall of Fame Even though I walk in the church And burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You xags think its all a game Til I walk a flock of flames Off of planking tell me What in the xuck are you thinking Little gay looking boy So gay I can barely say it With a straight face looking boy You witnessing a massacre Like you watching a church Gathering take place looking boy Oy vey that boys gay Thats all they say looking boy You get a thumbs up pat on the back And a way to go from your label Every day looking boy hey looking boy What you say looking boy I got a hell yeah from Dre looking boy Ima work for everything I have Never ask nobody for xhit Get outta my face looking boy Basically boy youre never gonna be capable To keep up with the same pace looking boy Cause Im beginning to Feel like a rap God rap God All my people from the front to the Back nod back nod The way Im racing around the track Call me NASCAR NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park The White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard So you be Thor and Ill be Odin You rodent Im omnipotent Let off then Im reloading Immediately with these bombs Im totin And I should not be woken Im the walking dead But Im just a talking head A zombie floating But I got your mom deep throating Im out my ramen noodle We have nothing in common poodle Im a doberman pinch yourself In the arm and pay homage pupil Its me my honestys brutal But its honestly futile If I dont utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle Enough rhymes to maybe to try And help get some people Through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me Like its lunchtime I know there was a time Where once I was king of the underground But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes But sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and Here they come trying to Censor you like that one line I said on Im back from the Mathers LP One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine Put em all in a line add an AK47 A revolver and a nine See if I get away with it now That I aint as big as I was but Ive Morphed into an immortal Coming through the portal Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I dont know what the xuck that you Rhyme for youre pointless As Rapunzel with xucking cornrows Youre like normal xuck being normal And I just bought a new Ray gun from the future To just come and shoot ya Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a xag At Maywhethers pad singin to a man While they played piano Man oh man that was a 247 Special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio Station the very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed JJ Faduh sama lamaa duma lamaa You assuming Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything You saying ricocheting off of me And itll glue to you Im never stating More than never demonstrating How to give a motherxuckin Audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know that The haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyd be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music You make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do When they get jealous they confuse it Its not hip hop its pop Cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on lose yourself and make em lose it I dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to use Let me know when it occurs to you While Im ripping any one of These verses diverse as you Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if youre half as nice at songs You can sacrifice virgins too uh School flunkie pill junky But look at the accolades The skills brung me full of myself But still hungry I bully myself Cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you ill When I speak in tongues But its still tongue in cheek xuck you Im drunk so Satan take the xucking wheel Im asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boys Still chunky but funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils Heres what they want from me They asking me to eliminate Some of the women hate But if you take into consideration The bitter hatred that I had Then you may be a little Patient and more Sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But xuck it Lifes handing you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the xuck am I supposed to Bake them a cake then Dont mistake it for Satan Its a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and Dont be a retard be a king think not Why be a king when you can be a God" /><meta name="generator" content="Hugo 0.119.0"><link

<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to feel<br>
like a rap God rap God<br>
All my people<br>
from the front to the<br>
Back nod<br>
back nod<br>
Now who thinks<br>
their arms are long<br>
Enough to<br>
slap box slap box<br>
They said I rap<br>
like a robot<br>
So call me<br>
rapbot<br>
But for me to rap<br>
like a computer<br>
Must be<br>
in my genes<br>
I got a laptop<br>
in my back pocket<br>
My pen&rsquo;ll go off<br>
when I half-cock it<br>
Got a fat knot from<br>
that rap profit<br>
Made a living<br>
and a killing off it<br>
Ever since<br>
Bill Clinton was<br>
Still in office<br>
with Monica Lewinsky<br>
Feeling on<br>
his nutsack<br>
I&rsquo;m an MC<br>
still as honest<br>
But as rude<br>
and indecent<br>
As all hell syllables<br>
killaholic<br>
(Kill &rsquo;em<br>
all with)<br>
This slickety gibbedy<br>
hibbedy hip hop<br>
You don&rsquo;t<br>
really wanna<br>
Get into a<br>
pissing match<br>
With this<br>
rappidy rap<br>
Packing a Mac<br>
in the back of the Ac<br>
Pack backpack rap yep<br>
yackety-yak<br>
The exact<br>
same time<br>
I attempt these<br>
lyrical acrobat stunts<br>
While<br>
I&rsquo;m practicing<br>
That I&rsquo;ll still be<br>
able to<br>
Break a motherxuckin&rsquo;<br>
table<br>
Over the back of a<br>
couple of xaggots<br>
And crack it<br>
in half<br>
Only realized<br>
it was ironic<br>
I was signed to<br>
aftermath<br>
After the fact<br>
how could I not blow?<br>
All I do is drop<br>
F-bombs<br>
Feel my<br>
wrath of attack<br>
Rappers are having a<br>
rough time period<br>
Here&rsquo;s a<br>
maxipad<br>
It&rsquo;s actually<br>
disastrously bad<br>
For the wack while<br>
I&rsquo;m masterfully<br>
Constructing<br>
this masterpiece as<br>
I&rsquo;m beginning to feel<br>
like a rap God rap God<br>
All my people<br>
from the front to the<br>
Back nod<br>
back nod<br>
Now who thinks<br>
their arms are long<br>
Enough to<br>
slap box slap box<br>
Let me show you<br>
maintaining<br>
This shit ain&rsquo;t<br>
that hard that hard<br>
Everybody want the key<br>
and the secret to rap<br>
Immortality like<br>
I have got<br>
Well to be truthful<br>
the blueprint&rsquo;s<br>
Simply rage and<br>
youthful exuberance<br>
Everybody loves<br>
to root for a nuisance<br>
Hit the earth<br>
like an asteroid<br>
Did nothing but shoot<br>
for the moon since<br>
MC&rsquo;s get taken to<br>
school with this music<br>
&lsquo;Cause I<br>
use it<br>
As a vehicle to<br>
bust a rhyme<br>
Now I lead a<br>
new school<br>
Full of students<br>
me?<br>
I&rsquo;m a product of Rakim<br>
Lakim Shabazz 2Pac<br>
N.W.A Cube Hey Doc<br>
Ren Yella Eazy<br>
Thank you<br>
they got Slim<br>
Inspired enough to<br>
one day grow up<br>
Blow up and be<br>
in a position<br>
To meet Run DMC<br>
and induct them<br>
Into the<br>
motherxuckin&rsquo;<br>
Rock n&rsquo; roll<br>
Hall of Fame<br>
Even though<br>
I walk in the church<br>
And burst<br>
in a ball of flames<br>
Only<br>
Hall of Fame<br>
I be inducted in<br>
is the alcohol of fame<br>
On the wall of<br>
shame<br>
You xags think<br>
it&rsquo;s all a game<br>
&lsquo;Til I walk a<br>
flock of flames<br>
Off of planking<br>
tell me<br>
What in the xuck<br>
are you thinking?<br>
Little gay<br>
looking boy<br>
So gay I can barely<br>
say it<br>
With a straight<br>
face looking boy<br>
You witnessing<br>
a massacre<br>
Like you<br>
watching a church<br>
Gathering take place<br>
looking boy<br>
Oy vey<br>
that boy&rsquo;s gay<br>
That&rsquo;s all they say<br>
looking boy<br>
You get a thumbs up<br>
pat on the back<br>
And a way to go from<br>
your label<br>
Every day looking boy<br>
hey looking boy<br>
What you say<br>
looking boy?<br>
I got a &ldquo;hell yeah&rdquo;<br>
from Dre looking boy<br>
I&rsquo;ma work for<br>
everything I have<br>
Never ask nobody<br>
for xhit<br>
Get outta my face<br>
looking boy<br>
Basically boy you&rsquo;re<br>
never gonna be capable<br>
To keep up with the<br>
same pace looking boy<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m<br>
beginning to<br>
Feel like a<br>
rap God rap God<br>
All my people<br>
from the front to the<br>
Back nod<br>
back nod<br>
The way I&rsquo;m racing<br>
around the track<br>
Call me<br>
NASCAR NASCAR<br>
Dale Earnhardt of<br>
the trailer park<br>
The White Trash<br>
God<br>
Kneel before<br>
General Zod<br>
This planet&rsquo;s Krypton<br>
no Asgard Asgard<br>
So you be Thor<br>
and I&rsquo;ll be Odin<br>
You rodent<br>
I&rsquo;m omnipotent<br>
Let off then<br>
I&rsquo;m reloading<br>
Immediately with these<br>
bombs I&rsquo;m totin&rsquo;<br>
And I should<br>
not be woken<br>
I&rsquo;m the<br>
walking dead<br>
But I&rsquo;m just a<br>
talking head<br>
A zombie<br>
floating<br>
But I got your mom<br>
deep throating<br>
I&rsquo;m out my<br>
ramen noodle<br>
We have nothing<br>
in common poodle<br>
I&rsquo;m a doberman<br>
pinch yourself<br>
In the arm and<br>
pay homage pupil<br>
It&rsquo;s me<br>
my honesty&rsquo;s brutal<br>
But it&rsquo;s honestly<br>
futile<br>
If I don&rsquo;t utilize<br>
what I do though<br>
For good at least once<br>
in a while<br>
So I wanna make sure<br>
somewhere<br>
In this chicken<br>
scratch<br>
I scribble<br>
and doodle<br>
Enough rhymes to<br>
maybe to try<br>
And help<br>
get some people<br>
Through<br>
tough times<br>
But I gotta keep a few<br>
punchlines<br>
Just in case &lsquo;cause<br>
even you unsigned<br>
Rappers are hungry<br>
looking at me<br>
Like it&rsquo;s<br>
lunchtime<br>
I know<br>
there was a time<br>
Where once I was king<br>
of the underground<br>
But I still<br>
rap like<br>
I&rsquo;m on my<br>
Pharoahe Monch grind<br>
So I crunch<br>
rhymes<br>
But sometimes<br>
when you combine<br>
Appeal with the skin<br>
color of mine<br>
You get<br>
too big and<br>
Here they<br>
come trying to<br>
Censor you like that<br>
one line<br>
I said on &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back&rdquo;<br>
from the Mathers LP<br>
One where<br>
I tried to say<br>
I take seven kids<br>
from Columbine<br>
Put &rsquo;em all in a line<br>
add an AK-47<br>
A revolver<br>
and a nine<br>
See if I get away<br>
with it now<br>
That I ain&rsquo;t as big as<br>
I was but I&rsquo;ve<br>
Morphed<br>
into an immortal<br>
Coming<br>
through the portal<br>
You&rsquo;re stuck in a time<br>
warp from 2004 though<br>
And I don&rsquo;t know<br>
what the xuck that you<br>
Rhyme for<br>
you&rsquo;re pointless<br>
As Rapunzel<br>
with xucking cornrows<br>
You&rsquo;re like normal<br>
xuck being normal<br>
And I just<br>
bought a new<br>
Ray gun<br>
from the future<br>
To just<br>
come and shoot ya<br>
Like when Fabolous<br>
made Ray J mad<br>
&lsquo;Cause Fab said<br>
he looked like a xag<br>
At Maywhether&rsquo;s pad<br>
singin&rsquo; to a man<br>
While they played<br>
piano<br>
Man oh man<br>
that was a 24/7<br>
Special<br>
on the cable channel<br>
So Ray J went<br>
straight to the radio<br>
Station the<br>
very next day<br>
&ldquo;Hey Fab<br>
I&rsquo;ma kill you&rdquo;<br>
Lyrics coming at you<br>
at supersonic speed<br>
(JJ Fad)uh sama lamaa<br>
duma lamaa<br>
You assuming<br>
I&rsquo;m a human<br>
What I gotta do to<br>
get it through to you<br>
I&rsquo;m superhuman<br>
innovative and<br>
I&rsquo;m made of rubber<br>
so that anything<br>
You saying ricocheting<br>
off of me<br>
And it&rsquo;ll glue to you<br>
I&rsquo;m never stating<br>
More than never<br>
demonstrating<br>
How to give a<br>
motherxuckin&rsquo;<br>
Audience a feeling<br>
like it&rsquo;s levitating<br>
Never fading<br>
and I know that<br>
The haters are<br>
forever waiting<br>
For the day<br>
that they can say<br>
I fell off<br>
they&rsquo;d be celebrating<br>
&lsquo;Cause I know the way<br>
to get &rsquo;em motivated<br>
I make<br>
elevating music<br>
You make<br>
elevator music<br>
Oh he&rsquo;s too<br>
mainstream<br>
Well that&rsquo;s<br>
what they do<br>
When they get jealous<br>
they confuse it<br>
It&rsquo;s not hip hop<br>
it&rsquo;s pop<br>
&lsquo;Cause I found a<br>
hella way to fuse it<br>
With rock<br>
shock rap with Doc<br>
Throw on lose yourself<br>
and make &rsquo;em lose it<br>
I don&rsquo;t know how to<br>
make songs like that<br>
I don&rsquo;t know<br>
what words to use<br>
Let me know<br>
when it occurs to you<br>
While I&rsquo;m ripping<br>
any one of<br>
These verses<br>
diverse as you<br>
It&rsquo;s<br>
curtains<br>
I&rsquo;m inadvertently<br>
hurtin&rsquo; you<br>
How many verses<br>
I gotta murder to<br>
Prove that if you&rsquo;re<br>
half as nice at songs<br>
You can sacrifice<br>
virgins too uh<br>
School flunkie<br>
pill junky<br>
But look at the<br>
accolades<br>
The skills brung me<br>
full of myself<br>
But still hungry<br>
I bully myself<br>
&lsquo;Cause I make me do<br>
what I put my mind to<br>
And I&rsquo;m a million<br>
leagues above you ill<br>
When I speak in<br>
tongues<br>
But it&rsquo;s still tongue<br>
in cheek xuck you<br>
I&rsquo;m drunk so Satan<br>
take the xucking wheel<br>
I&rsquo;m asleep<br>
in the front seat<br>
Bumping Heavy D<br>
and the Boys<br>
Still chunky<br>
but funky<br>
But in my head<br>
there&rsquo;s something<br>
I can feel tugging<br>
and struggling<br>
Angels fight<br>
with devils<br>
Here&rsquo;s<br>
what they want from me<br>
They asking me to<br>
eliminate<br>
Some of the<br>
women hate<br>
But if you take<br>
into consideration<br>
The bitter hatred<br>
that I had<br>
Then you<br>
may be a little<br>
Patient<br>
and more<br>
Sympathetic<br>
to the situation<br>
And understand<br>
the discrimination<br>
But<br>
xuck it<br>
Life&rsquo;s handing you<br>
lemons<br>
Make<br>
lemonade then<br>
But if I can&rsquo;t batter<br>
the women<br>
How the xuck<br>
am I supposed to<br>
Bake them a<br>
cake then?<br>
Don&rsquo;t mistake it<br>
for Satan<br>
It&rsquo;s a fatal<br>
mistake<br>
If you think<br>
I need to be overseas<br>
And take a vacation<br>
to trip a broad<br>
And make her<br>
fall on her face and<br>
Don&rsquo;t be a retard<br>
be a king? think not<br>
Why be a king<br>
when you can be a God?</p>
