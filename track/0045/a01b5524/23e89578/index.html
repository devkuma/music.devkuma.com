Slim Shady<br>
Hi kids<br>
do you like violence?<br>
Wanna see me stick<br>
nine inch nails<br>
Through each one of<br>
my eyelids?<br>
Wanna copy me and do<br>
exactly like I did?<br>
Try &lsquo;cid<br>
and get fXX up<br>
Worse that<br>
my life is?<br>
My brain&rsquo;s<br>
dead weight<br>
I&rsquo;m tryin to get<br>
my head straight<br>
But I can&rsquo;t figure out<br>
which Spice Girl<br>
I want to impregnate<br>
and Dr.Dre said<br>
&ldquo;Slim Shady<br>
you a basehead&rdquo;<br>
Uh uh &ldquo;then why&rsquo;s<br>
ya face red?<br>
Man you wasted&rdquo;<br>
well since age 12<br>
I&rsquo;ve felt like<br>
I&rsquo;m someone else<br>
Cuz I hung<br>
my original self<br>
From the top bunk<br>
with a belt<br>
Got pissed off<br>
and ripped<br>
Pamela Lee&rsquo;s tits off<br>
and smacked her<br>
So hard<br>
I knocked her clothes<br>
Backwards<br>
like Kris Kross<br>
I smoke a fat<br>
pound of grass<br>
And fall on my ass<br>
faster than a fatbitch<br>
Who sat down too fast<br>
c&rsquo;mere slut<br>
Shady wait a minute<br>
that&rsquo;s my girl dog<br>
I don&rsquo;t give a fXX<br>
God sent me<br>
To piss the world off<br>
hi my name is (what?)<br>
My name is (who?)<br>

Hi My name is (huh?)<br>

Hi my name is (huh?)<br>

My name is Slim Shady<br>
my English teacher<br>
Wanted to flunk me<br>
in junior high<br>
Thanks a lot<br>
next semester<br>
I&rsquo;ll be thirty-five<br>
I smacked him<br>
In his face<br>
with an eraser<br>
Chased him<br>
with a stapler<br>
And stapled his nuts<br>
to a stack of papers<br>
Walked<br>
in the strip club<br>
Had my jacket<br>
zipped up<br>
Flashed<br>
the bartender<br>
And stuck my dick<br>
in the tip cup<br>
Extraterrestrial<br>
runnin over<br>
Pedestrians<br>
in a spaceship<br>
While they<br>
screamin at me<br>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just<br>
be friends&rdquo;<br>
99% of my life<br>
I was lied to<br>
I just found out<br>
my mom<br>
Does more dope<br>
than I do<br>
I told her I&rsquo;d grow up<br>
to be a famous rapper<br>
Make a record<br>
about doin&rsquo; drugs<br>
And name it after her<br>
you know you blew up<br>
When the women<br>
rush your stands<br>
To try to touch<br>
your hands<br>
Like some screamin<br>
Usher fans<br>
This guy at<br>
White Castle<br>
Asked for my autograph<br>
so I signed it:<br>
&lsquo;Dear Dave thanks for<br>
the support ASSHOLE&rsquo;<br>
Hi my name is (what?)<br>

My name is<br>

Stop the tape<br>
this kid needs<br>
To be locked away<br>
Dr.Dre<br>
Don&rsquo;t just stand<br>
there OPERATE<br>
I&rsquo;m not ready to leave<br>
it&rsquo;s too scary to die<br>
I&rsquo;ll have to be<br>
carried inside<br>
The cemetery<br>
and buried alive<br>
Am I comin&rsquo; or goin&rsquo;?<br>
I can barely decide<br>
I just drank<br>
a fifth of vodka<br>
Dare me<br>
to drive?<br>
All my life<br>
I was very deprived<br>
I ain&rsquo;t had<br>
a woman in years<br>
My palms are<br>
too hairy to hide<br>
Clothes ripped like<br>
the Incredible Hulk<br>
I spit when I talk<br>
I&rsquo;ll fXX anything<br>
That walks<br>
when I was little<br>
I used to get<br>
so hungry<br>
I would throw fits<br>
how you gonna<br>
Breast feed me uh?<br>
you ain&rsquo;t got no tits<br>
I lay awake and<br>
slap myself in the bed<br>
Put a bulleproof<br>
vest on<br>
And shoot myself<br>
in the head<br>
I&rsquo;m steamin&rsquo; mad<br>
and by the way<br>
When you see my dad?<br>
tell him<br>
I slit his throat<br>
in this dream I had<br>
Hi my name is (what?)<br>
my name is (who?)<br>
My name is<br>
Slim Shady<br>
Hi My name is (huh?)<br>
