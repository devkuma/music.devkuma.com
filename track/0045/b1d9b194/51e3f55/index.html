    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79030" target="_black">79030</a></p>
<p>Thought you were<br>
just another Romeo<br>
The shoe you pass by<br>
in the store window<br>
But soon as<br>
I got home I wish<br>
I&rsquo;d bought<br>
you instead<br>
I got it bad<br>
I&rsquo;ll take the black<br>
Take the navy<br>
and red<br>
No other man has<br>
ever<br>
Ever had<br>
quite this effect<br>
I sleep<br>
alone<br>
&lsquo;Cause there&rsquo;s no room<br>
in my bed<br>
For any other lover<br>
with no gun to my head<br>
Your kisses hold me<br>
hostage<br>
And I don&rsquo;t wanna<br>
stop it<br>
&lsquo;Cause I only wanna<br>
give it to you<br>
And I want you<br>
more than<br>
A new<br>
pair of shoes<br>
I only wanna<br>
give it to you<br>
And I sure do<br>
hope<br>
That you feel<br>
like I do<br>
I came before<br>
this digital ocean<br>
Where folks only move<br>
in digital motion<br>
But you&rsquo;re<br>
so classic<br>
I want you<br>
more than my Adidas<br>
All the bees are<br>
gettin&rsquo; at you<br>
&lsquo;Cause your honey is<br>
sweeter<br>
I need ya<br>
with no gun to my head<br>
Your kisses hold me<br>
hostage<br>
And I don&rsquo;t wanna<br>
stop it<br>
&lsquo;Cause I only wanna<br>
give it to you<br>
And I want you<br>
more than<br>
A new<br>
pair of shoes<br>
I only wanna<br>
give it to you<br>
And I sure do<br>
hope<br>
That you feel<br>
like I do<br>
Can&rsquo;t let this go<br>
what can I say<br>
I just<br>
don&rsquo;t know<br>
My love ain&rsquo;t no trip<br>
for the weekend<br>
Here to stay<br>
for all of the seasons<br>
You&rsquo;re the weakness<br>
that I can&rsquo;t control<br>
Baby you all<br>
I need to get by<br>
You fly so you&rsquo;re all<br>
I need to get high<br>
You got it<br>
so put ya number<br>
In this camera<br>
phone<br>
And we can live<br>
like the camera&rsquo;s on<br>
No script<br>
though<br>
These boys claiming<br>
they ball<br>
Got no grip<br>
though<br>
My flow switch mode<br>
it&rsquo;s so schizo<br>
So I&rsquo;m the one<br>
that your girl<br>
Blow<br>
a kiss for<br>
You&rsquo;ve got to love me<br>
cold world no snuggie<br>
Baddest girls hug me<br>
my mind on you though<br>
You&rsquo;re hoping<br>
I&rsquo;m the one<br>
But I already knew<br>
though<br>
It ain&rsquo;t<br>
no secret<br>
That I get around<br>
true<br>
But girl<br>
you make me<br>
Want to settle down<br>
with you<br>
Get a crib<br>
with a view<br>
Lay up in the bed<br>
make a kid maybe 2<br>
All my ex-girlfriends<br>
gon have to get a clue<br>
&lsquo;Cause the rumors<br>
that you<br>
Heard about is<br>
true<br>
I said I only wanna<br>
give it to you<br>
And I want you<br>
more than<br>
A new<br>
pair of shoes<br>
I only wanna<br>
give it to you<br>
And I sure do<br>
hope<br>
That you feel<br>
like I do<br>
I said I only wanna<br>
give it to you<br>
And I want you<br>
more than<br>
A new<br>
pair of shoes<br>
I I I I I wanna<br>
give it to you<br>
And I sure do<br>
hope<br>
That you feel<br>
that you feel<br>
Like<br>
I do</p>
