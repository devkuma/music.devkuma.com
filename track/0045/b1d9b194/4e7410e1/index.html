    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79138" target="_black">79138</a></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help<br>
being depressed<br>
When I look down<br>
at my chest<br>
Oh yes<br>
my chest<br>
It might as well<br>
be nonexistent<br>
How can I ever compete<br>
with 34 double D&rsquo;s<br>
And I&rsquo;m rollin&rsquo;<br>
my eyes<br>
When I look down<br>
at my thighs<br>
They might as well<br>
tape everything<br>
That I eat<br>
to my legs<br>
I am too broke<br>
for the knife<br>
Too lazy<br>
to excercise<br>
But if I had<br>
hazel eyes<br>
Maybe<br>
I could be fly<br>
If I had<br>
no cellulite<br>
Big breasts<br>
and pockets real wide<br>
Then maybe I maybe<br>
I I I could be so fly<br>
And if I had<br>
a small waist<br>
I&rsquo;d make<br>
the boys go insane<br>
Then maybe I maybe<br>
I I I could be so fly<br>
So fly so fly<br>
so fly<br>
Now<br>
listen<br>
I&rsquo;ve got<br>
a beautiful soul<br>
But only 4 people<br>
know<br>
They&rsquo;ve known me<br>
since I was 10<br>
Beauty did not<br>
matter then<br>
Now in my 20&rsquo;s<br>
all that matters<br>
Is sex cars<br>
and money<br>
I ain&rsquo;t got<br>
none of the three<br>
So basically<br>
I am<br>
Invisible<br>
to all of the fellas<br>
And I sit<br>
at home jealous<br>
There was<br>
no golden ticket<br>
In my chocolate<br>
today<br>
And worst of all<br>
I&rsquo;m reminded<br>
In the cruellest<br>
ways<br>
Of how I don&rsquo;t look<br>
and I should look<br>
And that&rsquo;s<br>
why I say<br>
If I had<br>
no cellulite<br>
Big breasts<br>
and pockets real wide<br>
Then maybe I maybe<br>
I I I could be so fly<br>
And if I had<br>
a small waist<br>
I&rsquo;d make<br>
the boys go insane<br>
Then maybe I maybe<br>
I I I could be so fly<br>
So fly so fly<br>
so fly<br>
So fly so fly<br>
so fly fly<br>
So basically<br>
all I need<br>
Is to be everything<br>
but me<br>
Colored contacts<br>
liposuction<br>
And some<br>
implants<br>
Somehow that<br>
don&rsquo;t make much sense<br>
I must be<br>
out of my head<br>
If I think<br>
that I am governed<br>
By material<br>
things<br>
So I decided I&rsquo;m<br>
the definition of fly<br>
And if you want<br>
to know why<br>
I know<br>
what money can&rsquo;t buy<br>
Don&rsquo;t go<br>
believin&rsquo; the hype<br>
There&rsquo;s no runway<br>
in the sky<br>
And no way<br>
you could be fly<br>
Not if it costs you<br>
a dime<br>
If I had<br>
no cellulite<br>
Big breasts<br>
and pockets real wide<br>
Then maybe I maybe<br>
I I I could be so fly<br>
If I had<br>
no cellulite<br>
Boys<br>
go insane<br>
Then maybe I maybe<br>
I I I could be so fly</p>
