<p>I know<br>
it&rsquo;s a bad idea<br>
But<br>
how can I help myself<br>
Been inside<br>
for most this year<br>
And I thought<br>
a few drinks<br>
They might<br>
help<br>
It&rsquo;s been a while<br>
my dear<br>
Dealin&rsquo; with the cards<br>
life dealt<br>
I&rsquo;m still holdin&rsquo; back<br>
these tears<br>
While my friends are<br>
somewhere else<br>
I pictured this year<br>
a little bit different<br>
When it hit<br>
February<br>
I step in the bar<br>
it hit me so hard<br>
Oh how can it<br>
be this heavy<br>
Every song reminds me<br>
you&rsquo;re gone<br>
And I feel the lump<br>
form in my throat<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m here<br>
alone<br>
Just dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my eyes closed<br>
&lsquo;Cause everywhere<br>
I look<br>
I still<br>
see you<br>
And time is movin&rsquo;<br>
so slow<br>
And<br>
I don&rsquo;t know<br>
What else<br>
that I can do<br>
So I&rsquo;ll keep dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my<br>
Eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
Closed<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
So I&rsquo;ll keep dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my<br>
Delusion is here<br>
again<br>
And I think<br>
you&rsquo;ll come home soon<br>
A word brings me<br>
right back in<br>
Then it&rsquo;s only me<br>
that&rsquo;s in this room<br>
I guess<br>
I could just pretend<br>
The colours are<br>
more than blue<br>
But I lost<br>
more than my friend<br>
I can&rsquo;t help<br>
but missin&rsquo; you<br>
I pictured this month<br>
a little bit different<br>
No one is ever<br>
ready<br>
And when it unfolds<br>
you get in a hole<br>
Oh how can it<br>
be this heavy<br>
Everything changes<br>
nothing&rsquo;s the same<br>
Except the truth is<br>
now you&rsquo;re gone<br>
And life<br>
just goes on<br>
So I&rsquo;m dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my eyes closed<br>
&lsquo;Cause everywhere<br>
I look<br>
I still<br>
see you<br>
And time is movin&rsquo;<br>
so slow<br>
And<br>
I don&rsquo;t know<br>
What else<br>
that I can do<br>
So I&rsquo;ll keep dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my<br>
Eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
closed<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
So I&rsquo;ll keep dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my<br>
Eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
Closed<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
Oh I keep dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my<br>
They&rsquo;re shutting<br>
the bar<br>
They&rsquo;re cleanin&rsquo;<br>
the floor<br>
And everyone is<br>
already home<br>
But<br>
I&rsquo;m on my own<br>
Still dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my eyes closed<br>
&lsquo;Cause everywhere<br>
I look<br>
I still<br>
see you<br>
And time is movin&rsquo;<br>
so slow<br>
And<br>
I don&rsquo;t know<br>
What else<br>
that I can do<br>
So I&rsquo;ll keep dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my<br>
Eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
Closed<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
Oh I keep dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my<br>
Eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
Closed<br>
eye-eye-eye-eyes<br>
Oh I keep dancin&rsquo;<br>
with my</p>
