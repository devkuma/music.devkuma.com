<p>Loving can<br>
hurt<br>
Loving can hurt<br>
sometimes<br>
But<br>
it&rsquo;s the only thing<br>
That<br>
I know<br>
When it gets hard<br>
you know<br>
It can get hard<br>
sometimes<br>
It is the only<br>
thing that<br>
Makes us<br>
feel alive<br>
We keep this love<br>
in a photograph<br>
We made these memories<br>
for ourselves<br>
Where our eyes are<br>
never closing<br>
Hearts are<br>
never broken<br>
Times forever<br>
frozen still<br>
So you can keep me<br>
inside the pocket<br>
Of your ripped jeans<br>
holdin&rsquo; me closer<br>
&lsquo;Til our eyes<br>
meet<br>
You won&rsquo;t ever<br>
be alone<br>
Wait for me<br>
to come home<br>
Loving can<br>
heal<br>
Loving can mend<br>
your soul<br>
And<br>
it&rsquo;s the only thing<br>
That<br>
I know know<br>
I swear<br>
it will get easier<br>
Remember that<br>
with every piece of ya<br>
And<br>
it&rsquo;s the only thing<br>
We take with us<br>
when we die<br>
We keep this love<br>
in this photograph<br>
We made these memories<br>
for ourselves<br>
Where our eyes are<br>
never closing<br>
Hearts were<br>
never broken<br>
Times forever<br>
frozen still<br>
So you can keep me<br>
inside the pocket<br>
Of your ripped jeans<br>
holdin&rsquo; me closer<br>
&lsquo;Til our eyes<br>
meet<br>
You won&rsquo;t ever<br>
be alone<br>
And if you hurt me<br>
that&rsquo;s OK<br>
Baby<br>
only words bleed<br>
Inside these pages<br>
you just hold me<br>
And I won&rsquo;t ever<br>
let you go<br>
Wait for me<br>
to come home<br>
Wait for me<br>
to come home<br>
Wait for me<br>
to come home<br>
Wait for me<br>
to come home<br>
Oh you can fit me<br>
inside the necklace<br>
You got<br>
when you were 16<br>
Next to your heartbeat<br>
where I should be<br>
Keep it deep<br>
within your soul<br>
And if you hurt me<br>
well that&rsquo;s OK<br>
Baby<br>
only words bleed<br>
Inside these pages<br>
you just hold me<br>
And I won&rsquo;t ever<br>
let you go<br>
When<br>
I&rsquo;m away<br>
I will remember<br>
how you kissed me<br>
Under the lamppost<br>
back on 6th street<br>
Hearing you whisper<br>
through the phone<br>
Wait for me<br>
to come home</p>
