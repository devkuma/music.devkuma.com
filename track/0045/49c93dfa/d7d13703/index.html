<p>I&rsquo;m at a party<br>
I don&rsquo;t wanna be at<br>
And I don&rsquo;t ever wear<br>
a suit and tie yeah<br>
Wonderin&rsquo; if I could<br>
sneak out the back<br>
Nobody&rsquo;s even<br>
lookin&rsquo; me in my eyes<br>
Can you take my hand<br>
finish my drink say<br>
Shall we dance<br>
hell yeah<br>
You know I love ya<br>
did I ever tell ya<br>
You make it<br>
better like that<br>
Don&rsquo;t think<br>
I fit in at this party<br>
Everyone&rsquo;s got so much<br>
to say yeah<br>
I always feel<br>
like I&rsquo;m nobody mmm<br>
Who wants to fit<br>
in anyway<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
I don&rsquo;t care<br>
When I&rsquo;m with my baby<br>
yeah<br>
All the bad things<br>
disappear<br>
And<br>
you&rsquo;re making me feel<br>
Like<br>

I can deal<br>
with the bad nights<br>
When I&rsquo;m with my baby<br>

With all these people<br>

&lsquo;Cause<br>
I really don&rsquo;t mind<br>
When you make it<br>
