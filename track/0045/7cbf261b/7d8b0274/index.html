<p>There&rsquo;s talk<br>
on the street<br>
It sounds so familiar-<br>
great expectations<br>
Everybody<br>
watching you&ndash;<br>
People you meet<br>
they all seem<br>
To know you<br>
even your old friends<br>
Treat you like<br>
you&rsquo;re something new-<br>
Johnny come lately<br>
the new kid in town<br>
Everybody loves you<br>
so don&rsquo;t let them<br>
Down&ndash;<br>
you look in her eyes<br>
The music<br>
begins to play<br>
Hopeless romantics<br>
here we go again<br>
But after a while<br>
you&rsquo;re looking<br>
The other way<br>
it&rsquo;s those restless<br>
Heart that<br>
never mend&ndash;<br>
Johnny come lately<br>
the new kid in town<br>
Will she still<br>
love you<br>
When you&rsquo;re<br>
not around&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things<br>
you should have<br>
Told- her<br>
but night after night<br>
You&rsquo;re<br>
willing to hold- her<br>
Just hold- her tears<br>
on your shoulder<br>
There&rsquo;s talk<br>
on the street<br>
It&rsquo;s there<br>
to remind- you<br>
That it doesn&rsquo;t<br>
really matter<br>
Which side you&rsquo;re on-<br>
you&rsquo;re walking away&ndash;<br>
And they&rsquo;re talking<br>
behind- you<br>
They will never<br>
forget you<br>
Till somebody<br>
new comes along-<br>
Where you been lately<br>
there&rsquo;s<br>
A new kid in town<br>
everybody loves him<br>
Don&rsquo;t- they<br>
now he&rsquo;s holding her<br>
And you&rsquo;re still<br>
around&mdash;- oh my my&ndash;<br>
There&rsquo;s<br>
a new kid in town&mdash;<br>
Just another<br>
new kid in town&mdash;-<br>
Oo- hoo everybody&rsquo;s<br>
talking about<br>
The new kid in town<br>
oo- hoo everybody&rsquo;s<br>
Walking like<br>
the new kid in town<br>
There&rsquo;s<br>
a new kid in town<br>
I don&rsquo;t want<br>
to Hear it<br>
There&rsquo;s<br>
a new kid in town<br>
I don&rsquo;t want to<br>
hear it there&rsquo;s<br>
A new kid in town<br>
there&rsquo;s<br>
A new kid in town<br>
there&rsquo;s<br>
A new kid in town<br>
everybody&rsquo;s talking<br>
There&rsquo;s<br>
a new kid in town<br>
People started<br>
walking<br>
There&rsquo;s<br>
a new kid in town<br>
There&rsquo;s<br>
a new kid in town-</p>
