<p>For awhile to love was<br>
all we could do<br>
We were young<br>
and we knew<br>
And our eyes<br>
were alive<br>
Deep inside we knew<br>
our love was true<br>
For awhile we paid<br>
no mind to the past<br>
We knew<br>
love would last<br>
Every night<br>
somethin&rsquo; right<br>
Would invite us<br>
to begin the dance<br>
Somethin&rsquo; happened<br>
along the way<br>
What used to be<br>
happy was sad<br>
Somethin&rsquo; happened<br>
along the way<br>
And yesterday was<br>
all we had<br>
And oh after<br>
the love has gone<br>
How could you<br>
lead me on<br>
And not let me<br>
stay around<br>
Oh oh oh after<br>
the love has gone<br>
What used to be<br>
right is wrong<br>
Can love that&rsquo;s lost<br>
be found<br>
For awhile<br>
to love each other<br>
With all<br>
we would ever need<br>
Love was strong<br>
for so long<br>
Never knew that<br>
what was wrong<br>
Oh baby<br>
wasn&rsquo;t right<br>
We tried to find<br>
what we had<br>
Till sadness was<br>
all we shared<br>
We were scared<br>
this affair<br>
Would lead<br>
our love into<br>
Somethin&rsquo; happened<br>
along the way<br>
Yesterday was<br>
all we had<br>
Somethin&rsquo; happened<br>
along the way<br>
What used to be<br>
happy is sad<br>
Somethin&rsquo; happened<br>
along the way<br>
Oh yesterday was<br>
all we had<br>
And oh after<br>
the love has gone<br>
How could you<br>
lead me on<br>
And not let me<br>
stay around<br>
Oh oh oh after<br>
the love has gone<br>
What used to be<br>
right is wrong<br>
Can love<br>
that&rsquo;s lost be found<br>
Oh oh<br>
oh oh oh<br>
Oh after the love<br>
has gone<br>
What used to be<br>
right is wrong<br>
Can love that&rsquo;s lost<br>
be found<br>
Oh oh oh after<br>
the love has gone<br>
What used to be<br>
right is wrong<br>
Can love that&rsquo;s lost<br>
be found<br>
Oh oh oh after<br>
the love has gone<br>
What used to be<br>
right is wrong<br>
Can love that&rsquo;s lost<br>
be found oh oh oh<br>
Oh oh oh after<br>
the love has gone<br>
What used to be<br>
right is wrong<br>
Can love that&rsquo;s lost<br>
be found<br>
Oh oh oh after<br>
the love has gone<br>
What used to be<br>
right is wrong<br>
Can love that&rsquo;s lost<br>
be found</p>
