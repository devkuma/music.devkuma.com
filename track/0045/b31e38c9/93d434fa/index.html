<p>This is a number one<br>
champion sound<br>
Yeah Estelle<br>
we &lsquo;bout to get down<br>
Who&rsquo;s the hottest<br>
in the world right now<br>
Just touched down in<br>
London town<br>
Bet they give me<br>
a pound<br>
Tell them<br>
put the money<br>
In my hand<br>
right now<br>
Tell the promoter<br>
we need more seats<br>
We just sold out<br>
all the floor seats<br>
Take me on a trip I&rsquo;d<br>
like to go someday<br>
Take me to New York<br>
I&rsquo;d love to see L.A.<br>
I really want to<br>
come kick it with you<br>
You&rsquo;ll be my<br>
American boy<br>
He said<br>
hey sister<br>
It&rsquo;s really really<br>
nice to meet ya<br>
I just met this<br>
5 foot 7 guys<br>
Who&rsquo;s just<br>
my type<br>
I like the way<br>
he&rsquo;s speaking<br>
His confidence is<br>
peaking<br>
Don&rsquo;t like his<br>
baggy jeans<br>
But Ima like<br>
what&rsquo;s underneath them<br>
And no I ain&rsquo;t<br>
been to MIA<br>
I heard that Cali<br>
never rains and<br>
New York<br>
heart awaits<br>
First let&rsquo;s see the<br>
west end<br>
I&rsquo;ll show you to<br>
my brethren<br>
I&rsquo;m liking this<br>
American boy<br>
American<br>
boy<br>
Take me on a trip I&rsquo;d<br>
like to go someday<br>
Take me to New York<br>
I&rsquo;d love to see LA<br>
I really want to<br>
come kick it with you<br>
You&rsquo;ll be my<br>
American boy<br>
American<br>
boy<br>
Can we get away<br>
this weekend<br>
Take me to Broadway<br>
let&rsquo;s go shopping baby<br>
Then we&rsquo;ll<br>
go to a cafe<br>
Let&rsquo;s go on the<br>
subway<br>
Take me to<br>
your hood<br>
I never been to<br>
Brooklyn<br>
And I&rsquo;d like to<br>
see what&rsquo;s good<br>
Dressed in all your<br>
fancy clothes<br>
Sneaker&rsquo;s looking<br>
fresh to def<br>
I&rsquo;m loving<br>
those shell toes<br>
Walking that walk<br>
talk that slick talk<br>
I&rsquo;m liking this<br>
American boy<br>
American<br>
boy<br>
Take me on a trip I&rsquo;d<br>
like to go someday<br>
Take me to New York<br>
I&rsquo;d love to see LA<br>
I really want to<br>
come kick it with you<br>
You&rsquo;ll be my<br>
American boy<br>
Who killin&rsquo; em<br>
in the UK<br>
Everybody gonna say<br>
you K<br>
Reluctantly<br>
because most of<br>
This press don&rsquo;t<br>
xuck wit me<br>
Estelle once said to<br>
me cool down down<br>
Don&rsquo;t act a fool<br>
now now<br>
I always act a fool<br>
aww aww<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nothing new<br>
now now<br>
He crazy I know<br>
what ya thinking<br>
Ribena I know<br>
what you&rsquo;re drinking<br>
Rap singer<br>
chain blinger<br>
Holla at the<br>
next chick<br>
Soon as you&rsquo;re<br>
blinking<br>
What&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re<br>
persona<br>
About this American<br>
brama am I shallow<br>
Cuz all my clothes<br>
designer<br>
Dressed smart like a<br>
London bloke<br>
Before he speak in<br>
his suit bespoke<br>
And you thought<br>
he was cute before<br>
Look at this pea coat<br>
tell me he&rsquo;s broke<br>
And I know you ain&rsquo;t<br>
into all that<br>
I heard your lyrics<br>
feel your spirit<br>
But I still talk that<br>
ca-assh<br>
Cuz a lot of wags<br>
wanna hear it<br>
And I&rsquo;m feeling like<br>
Mike at his baddest<br>
Like the pimps at<br>
their gladys<br>
And I know they<br>
love it<br>
So to hell with<br>
all that rubbish<br>
Would you be my love<br>
(could be mine)<br>
Would you be my love<br>
(could be mine)<br>
Could you be my love<br>
my love<br>
Would you be my<br>
American boy<br>
American<br>
boy<br>
Take me on a trip I&rsquo;d<br>
like to go someday<br>
Take me to Chicago<br>
San Francisco Bay<br>
I really want to<br>
come kick it with you<br>
You&rsquo;ll be my<br>
American boy<br>
American<br>
boy</p>
