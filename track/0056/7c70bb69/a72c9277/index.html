    <p>작곡: James Houston Scoggin / 작사: Words &amp; Music by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79217" target="_black">79217</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny<br>
when you find yourself<br>
Lookin&rsquo;<br>
from the outside<br>
I&rsquo;m standin&rsquo; here<br>
but all I want<br>
Is to be<br>
over there<br>
Why did I let<br>
myself believe<br>
Miracles could<br>
happen<br>
&lsquo;Cause now I have<br>
to pretend<br>
That I don&rsquo;t<br>
really care<br>
I thought you were<br>
my fairy tale<br>
A dream<br>
when I&rsquo;m not sleepin&rsquo;<br>
A wish upon a star<br>
that&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; true<br>
But everybody else<br>
could tell<br>
That I confused<br>
my feelings<br>
With<br>
the truth<br>
When there was<br>
me and you<br>
I swore<br>
I knew the melody<br>
That I heard<br>
you singin&rsquo;<br>
And when you smiled<br>
you made me feel<br>
Like I could<br>
sing along<br>
But then you went<br>
and changed the words<br>
Now my heart is<br>
empty<br>
I&rsquo;m only left<br>
with used to be&rsquo;s<br>
And once<br>
upon a song<br>
Now I know you&rsquo;re not<br>
a fairy tale<br>
And dreams were<br>
meant for sleepin&rsquo;<br>
And wishes on a star<br>
just don&rsquo;t come true<br>
&lsquo;Cause now even<br>
I can tell<br>
That I confused<br>
my feelings<br>
With<br>
the truth<br>
Because I liked<br>
the view<br>
When there was<br>
me and you<br>
I can&rsquo;t<br>
believe<br>
That I could be<br>
so blind<br>
It&rsquo;s like you were<br>
floatin&rsquo;<br>
While I was fallin&rsquo;<br>
and I didn&rsquo;t mind<br>
Because I liked<br>
the view<br>
I thought<br>
you felt it too<br>
When there was<br>
me and you</p>
