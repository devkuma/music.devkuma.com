<p>Jet setter go getter<br>
nothing better oh<br>
Call me Mr. Been<br>
there done that<br>
Top model<br>
chick to your<br>
Every day<br>
hood rat<br>
Less than all but<br>
more than a few<br>
But I&rsquo;ve never met<br>
one like you<br>
Been all<br>
over the world<br>
Done a little bit of<br>
everything<br>
Little bit of<br>
everywhere<br>
With a little bit of<br>
everyone<br>
All the girls<br>
I&rsquo;ve been with<br>
Things I&rsquo;ve seen it<br>
takes much to impress<br>
But sure enough you go<br>
it makes your soul<br>
Stand up from<br>
all the rest baby<br>
(I can be<br>
in love<br>
But I just don&rsquo;t know<br>
don&rsquo;t know girl)<br>
Baby one thing is<br>
for certain<br>
Whatever you do<br>
it&rsquo;s working<br>
Other girls<br>
don&rsquo;t matter<br>
In your presence<br>
can&rsquo;t do what you do<br>
There&rsquo;s a million<br>
girls around<br>
But I don&rsquo;t see no one<br>
but you<br>
Girl you&rsquo;re so one<br>
in a million you are<br>
Baby you&rsquo;re the<br>
best I ever had<br>
(Best I ever had)<br>
and I&rsquo;m certain that<br>
(There ain&rsquo;t<br>
nothing better<br>
No there ain&rsquo;t nothing<br>
better than this)<br>
You&rsquo;re not a<br>
regular girl<br>
You don&rsquo;t give a damn<br>
about your look<br>
Talking about I can&rsquo;t<br>
do it for you<br>
But you can do it<br>
for yourself<br>
Even though<br>
that ain&rsquo;t so<br>
Baby cause my dough<br>
don&rsquo;t know how to end<br>
But that independent<br>
thing I&rsquo;m with it<br>
All we do is<br>
win baby<br>
(I can be<br>
in love<br>
But I just don&rsquo;t know<br>
don&rsquo;t know girl)<br>
Baby one thing is<br>
for certain<br>
Whatever you do<br>
it&rsquo;s working<br>
Other girls<br>
don&rsquo;t matter<br>
In your presence<br>
can&rsquo;t do what you do<br>
There&rsquo;s a million<br>
girls around<br>
But I don&rsquo;t see no one<br>
but you<br>
Girl you&rsquo;re so one<br>
in a million you are<br>
Baby you&rsquo;re the<br>
best I ever had<br>
(Best I ever had)<br>
and I&rsquo;m certain that<br>
(There ain&rsquo;t<br>
nothing better<br>
No there ain&rsquo;t nothing<br>
better than this)<br>
Girl you&rsquo;re so one<br>
in a million you are<br>
Baby you&rsquo;re the<br>
best I ever had<br>
(Best I ever had)<br>
and I&rsquo;m certain that<br>
(There ain&rsquo;t<br>
nothing better<br>
No there ain&rsquo;t nothing<br>
better than this)<br>
Timing girl<br>
only one in the world<br>
Just one of a kind<br>
she mine<br>
Woo all that I can<br>
think about is<br>
What this thing<br>
could be a future baby<br>
Baby you&rsquo;re<br>
one of a kind<br>
That means that you&rsquo;re<br>
the only one for me<br>
Only one<br>
for me<br>
Girl you&rsquo;re so one<br>
in a million you are<br>
Baby you&rsquo;re the<br>
best I ever had<br>
(Best I ever had)<br>
and I&rsquo;m certain that<br>
(There ain&rsquo;t<br>
nothing better<br>
No there ain&rsquo;t nothing<br>
better than this)<br>
Girl you&rsquo;re so one<br>
