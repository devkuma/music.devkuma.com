<p>Let&rsquo;s go<br>

They say<br>

Have a drink clink<br>
found the Bud Light<br>
Bad xitches like me<br>
is hard to come by<br>
The Patron own<br>
let&rsquo;s go get it on<br>
The zone own<br>
yes I&rsquo;m in the zone<br>
Is it two three<br>
leave a good tip<br>
I&rsquo;ma blow<br>

And don&rsquo;t give two<br>
xhits<br>
I&rsquo;m on the floor floor<br>
I love to dance<br>
So give me more more<br>
&rsquo;til I can&rsquo;t stand<br>
Get on the floor<br>

If you want more more<br>
then here I am<br>
Starships were<br>
meant to fly<br>
Hands up<br>
and touch the sky<br>
Can&rsquo;t stop<br>
&lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re so high<br>
Let&rsquo;s do this<br>
one more time<br>
Starships were<br>
meant to fly<br>
Hands up<br>
and touch the sky<br>
Let&rsquo;s do this one<br>
last time can&rsquo;t stop<br>
We&rsquo;re higher<br>
than a motherxucker<br>
We&rsquo;re higher<br>
than a motherxucker<br>
We&rsquo;re higher<br>
than a motherxucker<br>
Jump in my hooptie<br>
hooptie hoop<br>
I own that<br>
and I ain&rsquo;t paying<br>
My rent this month<br>
I owe that<br>
But xuck who you want<br>
and xuck who you like<br>
That&rsquo;s<br>
our life<br>
There&rsquo;s no end<br>
in sight<br>
Twinkle twinkle<br>
little star<br>
Now everybody<br>
let me hear you say<br>
Ray ray ray<br>
now spend<br>
All your money<br>
&lsquo;cause today&rsquo;s pay day<br>
And if you&rsquo;re a G<br>
you a G G G<br>
My name is Onika<br>
you can call me Nicki<br>
Get on the floor<br>
floor<br>
Like<br>
it&rsquo;s your last chance<br>
If you want more more<br>
then here I am<br>
Starships were<br>
meant to fly<br>
Hands up<br>
and touch the sky<br>
Can&rsquo;t stop<br>
&lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re so high<br>
Let&rsquo;s do this<br>
one more time<br>
Starships were<br>
meant to fly<br>
Hands up<br>
and touch the sky<br>
Let&rsquo;s do this one<br>

We&rsquo;re higher<br>
