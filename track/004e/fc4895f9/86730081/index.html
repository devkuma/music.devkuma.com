<p>I wish<br>
I could define<br>
All the thoughts<br>
that cross my mind<br>
They seem to big<br>
for me to choose<br>
I don&rsquo;t know which<br>
ones to lose<br>
When I&rsquo;ve fallen down<br>
so far<br>
I think I&rsquo;ll never<br>
see your light<br>
Bouncing off of me<br>
shining down here<br>
From your eyes<br>
help me<br>
Figure out the<br>
difference<br>
Between right<br>
and wrong<br>
Weak and strong<br>
day and night<br>
Where I belong<br>
help me<br>
Make the right<br>
decisions<br>
Know which way to turn<br>
lessons to learn<br>
And just what<br>
my purpose is here<br>
Oh yeah it&rsquo;s like<br>
I got the signals<br>
Crossed with messages<br>
I can&rsquo;t decode<br>
Half asleep never<br>
wide awake<br>
And on complete<br>
overload<br>
I got so much<br>
information here<br>
And nothing<br>
I can really grasp<br>
I should know<br>
the truth<br>
But I&rsquo;m too afraid<br>
so I have to ask<br>
Help me (help me)<br>
figure out<br>
The difference<br>
between right<br>
And wrong<br>
weak and strong<br>
Day and night<br>
where I belong<br>
Help me (help me)<br>
make the right<br>
Decisions know<br>
which way to turn<br>
Lessons to learn<br>
and just what<br>
My purpose is here<br>
I Wanna know you<br>
More than anything<br>
I meet you<br>
In my every dream<br>
you&rsquo;re there for me<br>
You love me<br>
for who I am no angel<br>
Just an ordinary man<br>
help me figure out<br>
Why I&rsquo;m stuck<br>
in the middle<br>
Tryin&rsquo; to understand<br>
why I can&rsquo;t<br>
Why It&rsquo;s such a riddle<br>
got my eyes crossed<br>
Thinking so hard<br>
and I know<br>
I&rsquo;m missing the mark<br>
can you help me<br>
Sort out<br>
all this information<br>
I&rsquo;m just racking<br>
my brain<br>
Paying attention<br>
but I&rsquo;m still lost<br>
And at all cost<br>
I I I got to know<br>
Help me (help me)<br>
figure out<br>
The difference<br>
between right<br>
And wrong<br>
weak and strong<br>
Day and night<br>
Where I belong<br>
Help me (help me)<br>
