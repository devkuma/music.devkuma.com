<p>Hold up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Slow down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Back up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Step down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Can&rsquo;t you see there&rsquo;s no<br>
Other man above you?<br>
What a wicked way to<br>
Treat the girl that love you<br>
Hold up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Oh down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Something don&rsquo;t feel right<br>
Because it ain&rsquo;t right<br>
Especially comin&rsquo; up after midnight<br>
I smell your secret<br>
And I&rsquo;m not too perfect<br>
To ever feel this worthless<br>
How did it come down to this?<br>
Going through your call list<br>
I don&rsquo;t wanna lose my pride<br>
But I&rsquo;ma fuck me up a bitch<br>
Know that I kept it sexy<br>
And know I kept it fun<br>
There&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m missing<br>
Maybe my head for one<br>
What&rsquo;s worse lookin&rsquo; jealous or crazy?<br>
Jealous or crazy?<br>
Or like being walked all<br>
Over lately walked all over lately<br>
I&rsquo;d rather be crazy<br>
Hold up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Slow down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Back up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Step down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Can&rsquo;t you see there&rsquo;s no<br>
Other man above you?<br>
What a wicked way to<br>
Treat the girl that loves you<br>
Hold up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Oh down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Let&rsquo;s imagine for a moment that<br>
You never made a name for yourself<br>
Or mastered wealth<br>
They had you labeled as a king<br>
Never made it out the cage still<br>
Out there movin&rsquo; in them streets<br>
Never had the baddest woman in<br>
The game up in your sheets<br>
Would they be down to ride?<br>
No they used to hide<br>
From you lie to you<br>
But y&rsquo;all know we<br>
Were made for each other<br>
So I find you and hold you down<br>
Me sing se<br>
Hold up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Slow down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Back up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Step down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Can&rsquo;t you see there&rsquo;s no<br>
Other man above you?<br>
What a wicked way to<br>
Treat the girl that loves you<br>
Hold up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Oh down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Oh it is such a shame<br>
You let this good love go to waste<br>
I always keep the top tier 5 star<br>
Backseat lovin&rsquo; in the car<br>
Like make that wood like make that wood<br>
Holly like a boulevard<br>
What&rsquo;s worse lookin&rsquo; jealous or crazy?<br>
Jealous or crazy?<br>
Or like being walked all<br>
Over lately walked all over lately<br>
I&rsquo;d rather be crazy<br>
Hold up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Slow down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Back up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Step down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Can&rsquo;t you see there&rsquo;s no<br>
Other man above you?<br>
What a wicked way to<br>
Treat the girl that loves you<br>
Hold up they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
Oh down they don&rsquo;t<br>
Love you like I love you<br>
I hop up out<br>
The bed and get my swag on<br>
I look in the mirror say<br>
What&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s up<br>
I hop up out<br>
The bed and get my swag on<br>
I look in the mirror say<br>
What&rsquo;s up? what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s up what&rsquo;s up</p>
