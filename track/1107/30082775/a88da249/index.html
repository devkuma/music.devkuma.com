<p>I hate<br>
watching<br>
You laughing<br>
with all your crew<br>
I decided to not<br>
to give a fxxx now<br>
When you people<br>
talked<br>
Sxxxx<br>
and made fun of me<br>
I was so helpless<br>
couldn&rsquo;t do a thing<br>
When will<br>
someone ever<br>
Say no to you<br>
fxxx boi<br>
You think this is<br>
funny don&rsquo;t you<br>
There is someone<br>
who can&rsquo;t eat or pray<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
of you<br>
I just can&rsquo;t deal<br>
with it<br>
I really hate you<br>
but somehow<br>
I could teach you<br>
some more<br>
You&rsquo;re making<br>
yourself go crazy<br>
Whether you meant it<br>
or not<br>
I really hate you<br>
but somehow<br>
I hope you know<br>
that I&rsquo;m the only one<br>
Who truly cares and<br>
gives a fxxx about you<br>
I just can&rsquo;t deal<br>
with it<br>
I just can&rsquo;t deal<br>
with you<br>
I just can&rsquo;t deal<br>
with it<br>
I hate<br>
watching<br>
You lie<br>
to other people<br>
I decided not<br>
to give a fxxx though<br>
But what you say is<br>
all full of sxxx<br>
Even your best friends<br>
don&rsquo;t believe in you<br>
When will<br>
someone ever<br>
Speak the truth to you<br>
fxxx them<br>
You think I&rsquo;m crazy<br>
don&rsquo;t you<br>
There are<br>
so many things<br>
You overlooked for<br>
what you&rsquo;ve done<br>
I really hate you<br>
but somehow<br>
I could teach you<br>
some more<br>
You&rsquo;re making<br>
yourself go crazy<br>
Whether you meant it<br>
or not<br>
I really hate you<br>
but somehow<br>
I hope you know<br>
that I&rsquo;m the only one<br>
Who truly cares and<br>
gives a fxxx about you<br>
Getting into someone&rsquo;s<br>
life is so easy<br>
But also hurting is<br>
so easy<br>
So you never change<br>
or learn to be better<br>
All losers come<br>
like a nightmare<br>
But I&rsquo;m tougher<br>
and I&rsquo;m wiser<br>
I&rsquo;m strong enough<br>
to get through you<br>
&lsquo;Cause a person<br>
like me<br>
Writes better songs<br>
after people like you<br>
I really hate you<br>
but somehow<br>
I could teach you<br>
some more<br>
You&rsquo;re making<br>
yourself go crazy<br>
Whether you meant it<br>
or not<br>
I really hate you<br>
but somehow<br>
I hope you know<br>
that I&rsquo;m the only one<br>
Who truly cares and<br>
gives a fxxx about you<br>
I really hate you<br>
but somehow<br>
I could teach you<br>
some more<br>
I really hate you<br>
but somehow<br>
I hope you know<br>
that I&rsquo;m the only one<br>
Who truly cares and<br>
gives a fxxx about you</p>
