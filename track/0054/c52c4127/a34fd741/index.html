<p>If you could give me<br>
one good reason<br>
Why I should<br>
believe you<br>
Believe in all the<br>
things that you tell<br>
I would sure<br>
like to believe you<br>
My heart wants to<br>
receive you<br>
Just make me know<br>
that you are sincere<br>
You know I&rsquo;d love<br>
for you to lead me<br>
And follow<br>
thru completely<br>
So won&rsquo;t you give me<br>
all I ask for<br>
And if you give<br>
your very best<br>
To bring me<br>
happiness<br>
I&rsquo;ll show you just<br>
how much I adore you<br>
Cause you mean<br>
the world to me<br>
You are my everything<br>
I swear the only thing<br>
That matters<br>
matters to me<br>
Oh baby baby<br>
baby baby baby<br>
Cause you mean<br>
so much to me<br>
Now it&rsquo;s gonna<br>
take some workin&rsquo;<br>
But I believe<br>
you&rsquo;re worth it<br>
Long as<br>
your intentions<br>
Are good<br>
so good<br>
There is just one way<br>
to show it<br>
And boy I hope<br>
you know it that<br>
No one could love you<br>
like I could<br>
Lord knows<br>
I want to trust you<br>
And always<br>
how I&rsquo;d love you<br>
I&rsquo;m not sure if<br>
love is enough<br>
And I will not<br>
be forsaken<br>
And I hope<br>
there&rsquo;s no mistakin&rsquo;<br>
So tell me that<br>
you&rsquo;ll always be true<br>
Cause you mean<br>
the world to me<br>
You are my everything<br>
I swear the only thing<br>
That matters<br>
matters to me<br>
Oh baby baby<br>
baby baby baby<br>
Cause you mean<br>
so much to me<br>
Cause you mean<br>
the world to me<br>
You are my everything<br>
I swear the only thing<br>
That matters<br>
matters to me<br>
Oh baby baby<br>
baby baby baby<br>
Cause you mean<br>
so much to me<br>
There&rsquo;s a feeling<br>
in my heart<br>
That I know<br>
I can&rsquo;t escape<br>
So please<br>
don&rsquo;t let me fall<br>
Don&rsquo;t let it be<br>
too late<br>
There&rsquo;s a time<br>
when words are good<br>
And they just get<br>
in the way<br>
So show me<br>
how you feel<br>
Baby I&rsquo;m<br>
for real oh<br>
Baby baby baby<br>
baby baby<br>
Cause you mean<br>
the world to me<br>
You are my everything<br>
I swear the only thing<br>
That matters<br>
matters to me<br>
Oh baby baby<br>
baby baby baby<br>
Cause you mean<br>
so much to me<br>
Cause you mean<br>
the world to me<br>
You are my everything<br>
I swear the only thing<br>
That matters<br>
matters to me<br>
Oh baby baby<br>
baby baby baby<br>
Cause you mean<br>
so much to me<br>
You mean the world<br>
to me<br>
You are my everything<br>
the only thing<br>
That matters baby baby<br>
baby baby baby<br>
Cause you mean<br>
so much to me-</p>
