<p>My heart was paralyzed<br>
my head was oversized<br>
I&rsquo;ll take the high<br>
road like I should<br>
You said<br>
it&rsquo;s meant to be<br>
That it&rsquo;s not you<br>
it&rsquo;s me<br>
You&rsquo;re leaving now<br>
for my own good<br>
That&rsquo;s cool<br>
but if my friends ask<br>
Where you are<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna say<br>
She went down<br>
in an airplane<br>
Fried getting<br>
suntanned<br>
Fell in a cement mixer<br>
full of quicksand<br>
Help me help me I&rsquo;m no<br>
good at goodbyes<br>
She met a<br>
shark under water<br>
Fell and no one<br>
caught her<br>
I returned everything<br>
I ever bought her<br>
Help me help me<br>
I&rsquo;m all out of lies<br>
And ways to<br>
say you died</p>
<p>My pride still<br>
feels the sting<br>
You were<br>
my everything<br>
Someday I&rsquo;ll find<br>
a love likes yours<br>
She&rsquo;ll think<br>
I&rsquo;m superman<br>
Not<br>
super minivan<br>
How could you leave on<br>
Yom Kippur<br>
That&rsquo;s cool<br>
but if my friends ask<br>
Where you are<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna say<br>
She was caught<br>
in a mudslide<br>
Eaten<br>
by a lion<br>
Got run over by a<br>
crappy purple scion<br>
Help me help me I&rsquo;m no<br>
good at goodbyes<br>
She dried up<br>
in the desert<br>
Drowned<br>
in the hot tub<br>
Danced to death at<br>
an East Side nightclub<br>
Help me help me<br>
I&rsquo;m all out of lies<br>
And ways to<br>
say you died</p>
<p>I wanna<br>
live a thousand<br>
Lives<br>
with you<br>
I want to be the one<br>
you&rsquo;re dying to love<br>
But you don&rsquo;t<br>
want to<br>
That&rsquo;s cool<br>
but if my friends ask<br>
Where you are<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna say<br>
That&rsquo;s cool<br>
but if my friends ask<br>
Where you are<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna say<br>
She went down<br>
in an airplane<br>
Fried getting<br>
suntanned<br>
