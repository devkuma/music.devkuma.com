<hr>
<p>Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park<br>
I used to think I would meet somebody there<br>
Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop<br>
You used to work at to make a little money</p>
<p>Time<br>
Curious time<br>
Gave me no compasses<br>
Gave me no signs<br>
Were there clues I didn&rsquo;t see?<br>
And isn&rsquo;t it just so pretty to think<br>
All along there was some<br>
Invisible string<br>
Tying you to me?</p>
<p>Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA<br>
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner<br>
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes<br>
She said I looked like an American singer</p>
<p>Time<br>
Mystical time<br>
Cutting me open, then healing me fine<br>
Were there clues I didn&rsquo;t see?<br>
And isn&rsquo;t it just so pretty to think<br>
All along there was some<br>
Invisible string<br>
Tying you to me?</p>
<p>A string that pulled me<br>
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar<br>
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire<br>
Chains around my demons<br>
Wool to brave the seasons<br>
One single thread of gold tied me to you</p>
<p>Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart<br>
Now I send their babies presents<br>
Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park<br>
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven</p>
<p>Time<br>
Wondrous time<br>
Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies<br>
And it&rsquo;s cool<br>
Baby with me<br>
And isn&rsquo;t it just so pretty to think<br>
All along there was some<br>
Invisible string<br>
Tying you to me?</p>
