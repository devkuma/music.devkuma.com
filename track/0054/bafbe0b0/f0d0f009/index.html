<p>Nice to meet you<br>
where you&rsquo;ve been<br>
I could show you<br>
incredible things<br>
Magic madness<br>
heaven sin<br>
Saw you there<br>
and I thought<br>
Oh my God<br>
look at that face<br>
You look<br>
like my next mistake<br>
Love&rsquo;s a game<br>
wanna play<br>
New money<br>
suit and tie<br>
I can read you<br>
like a magazine<br>
Ain&rsquo;t it funny<br>
rumors fly<br>
And I know<br>
you heard about me<br>
So hey<br>
let&rsquo;s be friends<br>
I&rsquo;m dying to see<br>
how this one ends<br>
Grab your passport<br>
and my hand<br>
I can make<br>
the bad guys<br>
Good<br>
for a weekend<br>
So it&rsquo;s gonna be<br>
forever<br>
Or it&rsquo;s gonna go down<br>
in flames<br>
You can tell me<br>
when it&rsquo;s over<br>
If the high was<br>
worth the pain<br>
Got a long<br>
list of ex-lovers<br>
They&rsquo;ll tell you<br>
I&rsquo;m insane<br>
&lsquo;Cause you know<br>
I love the players<br>
And you love<br>
the game<br>
&lsquo;Cause we&rsquo;re young<br>
and we&rsquo;re reckless<br>
We&rsquo;ll take this way<br>
too far<br>
It&rsquo;ll<br>
leave you<br>
Breathless<br>
or with a nasty scar<br>
Got a long<br>
list of ex-lovers<br>
They&rsquo;ll tell you<br>
I&rsquo;m insane<br>
But I&rsquo;ve got<br>
a blank space baby<br>
And I&rsquo;ll<br>
write your name<br>
Cherry lips<br>
crystal skies<br>
I could show you<br>
incredible things<br>
Stolen kisses<br>
pretty lies<br>
You&rsquo;re the king<br>
baby I&rsquo;m your queen<br>
Find out<br>
what you want<br>
Be that girl<br>
for a month<br>
Wait the worst is<br>
yet to come oh no<br>
Screaming crying<br>
perfect storms<br>
I can make<br>
all the tables turn<br>
Rose garden filled<br>
with thorns<br>
Keep you second<br>
guessing like<br>
Oh my God<br>
who is she<br>
I get drunk<br>
on jealousy<br>
But you&rsquo;ll come back<br>
each time you leave<br>
&lsquo;Cause darling<br>
I&rsquo;m a nightmare<br>
Dressed<br>
like a daydream<br>
So it&rsquo;s gonna be<br>
forever<br>
Or it&rsquo;s gonna go down<br>
in flames<br>
You can tell me<br>
when it&rsquo;s over<br>
If the high was<br>
worth the pain<br>
Got a long<br>
list of ex-lovers<br>
They&rsquo;ll tell you<br>
I&rsquo;m insane<br>
&lsquo;Cause you know<br>
I love the players<br>
And you love<br>
the game<br>
&lsquo;Cause we&rsquo;re young<br>
and we&rsquo;re reckless<br>
We&rsquo;ll take this way<br>
too far<br>
It&rsquo;ll<br>
leave you<br>
Breathless<br>
or with a nasty scar<br>
Got a long<br>
list of ex-lovers<br>
They&rsquo;ll tell you<br>
I&rsquo;m insane<br>
But I&rsquo;ve got<br>
a blank space baby<br>
And I&rsquo;ll<br>
write your name<br>
Boys only want love<br>
if it&rsquo;s torture<br>
Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t say<br>
I didn&rsquo;t warn ya<br>
Boys only want love<br>
if it&rsquo;s torture<br>
Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t say<br>
I didn&rsquo;t warn ya<br>
So it&rsquo;s gonna be<br>
forever<br>
Or it&rsquo;s gonna go down<br>
in flames<br>
You can tell me<br>
