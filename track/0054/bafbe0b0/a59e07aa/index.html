<hr>
<p>You were in college working part time waitin’ tables<br>
Left a small town, never looked back<br>
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin’<br>
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts</p>
<p>Say, can you believe it?<br>
As we’re lying on the couch<br>
The moment, I can see it.<br>
Yes, yes, I can see it now</p>
<p>Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water<br>
You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter<br>
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine</p>
<p>Flash forward and we’re taking on the world together<br>
And there’s a drawer of my things at your place<br>
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I’m daunted<br>
You say we’ll never make my parent’s mistakes</p>
<p>But we got bills to pay<br>
We got nothing figured out<br>
When it was hard to take<br>
Yes, yes, I thought about</p>
<p>Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water<br>
You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter<br>
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine</p>
<p>Do you remember all the city lights on the water?<br>
You saw me start to believe for the first time<br>
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter<br>
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh</p>
<p>And I remember that fight<br>
Two-thirty AM<br>
Yes, everything was slipping right out of our hands<br>
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street<br>
Braced myself for the goodbye<br>
‘Cuz that’s all I’ve ever known<br>
And you took me by surprise<br>
You said I’ll never leave you alone</p>
<p>You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water<br>
And every time I look at you, it’s like the first time<br>
I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter<br>
She is the best thing that’s ever been mine</p>
<p>(Hold on, we&rsquo;ll make it last)<br>
(Hold on, never turn back)<br>
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man&rsquo;s careful daughter<br>
(Hold on) You are the best thing that&rsquo;s ever been mine</p>
<p>(Hold on) Do you believe it?<br>
(Hold on) We&rsquo;re gonna make it now<br>
(Hold on) And I can see it<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)(I can see it now)</p>
