    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=84878" target="_black">84878</a></p>
<p>Everyone thinks<br>
that I have it all<br>
But it&rsquo;s<br>
so empty<br>
Living behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
These castle<br>
walls<br>
If I should tumble<br>
if I should fall<br>
Would any one<br>
hear me<br>
Screaming behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
There&rsquo;s no one<br>
here at all<br>
Behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
Observing the estate<br>
through the gate<br>
From the outside<br>
looking in<br>
Bet you would think<br>
I got it made<br>
Better<br>
look again<br>
I got a butler<br>
got a maid<br>
And a mansion<br>
the belief is that<br>
I&rsquo;m living out<br>
a millionaires fantasy<br>
With Phantoms<br>
and Ferrari&rsquo;s<br>
In the<br>
driveway<br>
But you see it came<br>
in exchange<br>
Of the sane man&rsquo;s<br>
sanity<br>
Your vision<br>
jaded<br>
By the Grammy&rsquo;s<br>
on the mantelpiece<br>
Just switch<br>
your camera lenses<br>
You would see<br>
the agony<br>
Apparently<br>
it&rsquo;s damaging the man<br>
You see<br>
before you<br>
On the canvas<br>
he may seem alright<br>
But all<br>
the disadvantages<br>
His family<br>
encounters<br>
Overshadows<br>
his extravagance<br>
Walk in my nines<br>
a while<br>
I dare you I scare you<br>
while it surely<br>
Seem like the king&rsquo;s<br>
life seem glamorous<br>
As seen<br>
through the eyes<br>
Of untrained<br>
amateurs<br>
Because the camera&rsquo;s<br>
don&rsquo;t see<br>
Beyond the walls<br>
of the smiles<br>
On the castle till<br>
it falls in the pile<br>
Everyone thinks<br>
that I have it all<br>
But it&rsquo;s<br>
so empty<br>
Living behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
These castle<br>
walls<br>
If I should tumble<br>
if I should fall<br>
Would any one<br>
hear me<br>
Screaming behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
There&rsquo;s no one<br>
here at all<br>
Behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
Honestly to me<br>
I think I&rsquo;d lose<br>
Every benefit of all<br>
that I&rsquo;ve accomplished<br>
If my kids never went<br>
at shit<br>
Me knowing<br>
this<br>
Why should the verses<br>
I&rsquo;ve laid<br>
Be more important<br>
to me<br>
Than the persons<br>
I&rsquo;ve raised<br>
I guess<br>
I&rsquo;m saying that<br>
To say that<br>
opportunity<br>
But they just don&rsquo;t<br>
equate to<br>
All the time<br>
they take away<br>
From the kids<br>
all the shit<br>
I did right is<br>
a mistake<br>
If Deyjah end up<br>
a stripper and major<br>
Slinging<br>
yay<br>
How could<br>
I ever<br>
Consider myself<br>
a great<br>
If Messiah ain&rsquo;t<br>
paid<br>
And nique nique ain&rsquo;t<br>
straight<br>
Would your favorite<br>
song<br>
About the whips<br>
money and shit<br>
Be relevant<br>
if you found out<br>
The money wasn&rsquo;t<br>
real nope<br>
So me being<br>
the goat<br>
Shouldn&rsquo;t mean more<br>
to me<br>
Than see it<br>
to a king though<br>
From a bad ass kid<br>
to a man<br>
With some<br>
dough<br>
Otherwise I may well<br>
have stayed poor<br>
So while they stay<br>
focused on me<br>
Beefin with flip<br>
shawty low<br>
Gucci<br>
or Ludacris<br>
Or if I&rsquo;m xucking<br>
with a hoe<br>
Did I snitch<br>
when I got arrested<br>
Or will I die<br>
over nonsense<br>
Internally I&rsquo;m dealing<br>
with this conflict<br>
So excuse me<br>
if I don&rsquo;t<br>
Get the chance<br>
to kiss the hand<br>
That slapped me<br>
in the face<br>
Ay I&rsquo;m just<br>
a man<br>
If they saying<br>
I ain&rsquo;t the best<br>
At making<br>
hit records<br>
It&rsquo;s cause<br>
this my life<br>
These ain&rsquo;t<br>
just rapping shit<br>
Think at all nigga<br>
that deep did you dawg<br>
See you can&rsquo;t<br>
see the castle<br>
Full of walls<br>
till it falls<br>
Bitch ain&rsquo;t thinking<br>
was that did you dawg<br>
Cause see you can&rsquo;t<br>
see the castle<br>
Full of walls<br>
till it falls<br>
Everyone thinks<br>
that I have it all<br>
But it&rsquo;s<br>
so empty<br>
Living behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
These castle<br>
walls<br>
If I should tumble<br>
if I should fall<br>
Would any one<br>
hear me<br>
Screaming behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
There&rsquo;s no one<br>
here at all<br>
Behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
Nobody knows<br>
I&rsquo;m all alone<br>
Living in this castle<br>
made of stone<br>
They say that money is<br>
freedom<br>
But I feel trapped<br>
inside it all<br>
And while I sit<br>
so high up on a throne<br>
I wonder how I can<br>
feel this low<br>
On top of the world<br>
it&rsquo;s beautiful<br>
But there&rsquo;s no place<br>
to fall<br>
For the record<br>
ay<br>
I give<br>
a damn<br>
If I never sell<br>
shit again<br>
My career was<br>
meant for me<br>
To come<br>
and tell it<br>
Honest interpretation<br>
of how affected<br>
I&rsquo;m faced with matters<br>
most rappers<br>
Used to keep locked<br>
away in the basement<br>
Every day<br>
that I walk away<br>
I ain&rsquo;t saying<br>
that I&rsquo;m amazing<br>
Down playing<br>
the way<br>
I kept fellas<br>
catching cases<br>
Won&rsquo;t take<br>
into consideration<br>
How much it mean<br>
what I&rsquo;m saying<br>
And when I say<br>
what I mean<br>
Even when surrounded<br>
by the fakers<br>
From one of<br>
the greatest sinners<br>
Blessed with most<br>
of God&rsquo;s graces<br>
Who made his way<br>
amongst the greatest<br>
From the grimiest<br>
places<br>
So next time<br>
you rating royalty<br>
And more is being<br>
given to recordings<br>
Than the level<br>
of your loyalty<br>
Obvious you&rsquo;ve been<br>
ignoring me<br>
Who else ya seen make<br>
it through the storm<br>
Unharmed<br>
this charming<br>
While all<br>
the critics was<br>
Looking<br>
for Prince Charming<br>
Disregarded the king<br>
of the south<br>
But raised<br>
doubt<br>
Even though<br>
he made a castle<br>
Out of used<br>
to be a house<br>
He did shit<br>
that all<br>
Your favorites rappers<br>
only rap about<br>
But most of y&rsquo;all<br>
don&rsquo;t see the castle<br>
For the walls<br>
and the smiles till it<br>
Falls in the piles<br>
so wow<br>
Everyone thinks<br>
that I have it all<br>
But it&rsquo;s<br>
so empty<br>
Living behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
These castle<br>
walls<br>
If I should tumble<br>
if I should fall<br>
Would any one<br>
hear me<br>
Screaming behind<br>
these castle walls<br>
There&rsquo;s no one<br>
here at all<br>
Behind<br>
these castle walls</p>
