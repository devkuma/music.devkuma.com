<p>If we had the chance<br>
and the time to spend<br>
Would you do it again<br>
would you do it again<br>
Was it too much<br>
was it too much<br>
Now you&rsquo;re calling<br>
your friends<br>
Cuz I&rsquo;m gone again<br>
when I&rsquo;m back around<br>
Would you do it<br>
again<br>
Was it too much<br>
was it too much<br>
So tell me<br>
what got in the way<br>
And<br>
how I thought<br>
It was good<br>
that it changed<br>
And I&rsquo;m saying<br>
I&rsquo;m sorry again<br>
Oh I could never<br>
get out of my way<br>
Hit<br>
the store<br>
And your wardrobes<br>
replaced<br>
And still all that<br>
you do is complain<br>
You keep on throwing<br>
it back in my face<br>
And now you&rsquo;re<br>
telling me<br>
I need<br>
some space<br>
So I&rsquo;m laying<br>
in my bed<br>
Tripped off<br>
the shrooms now<br>
I&rsquo;ll be dead before<br>
I&rsquo;m without you now<br>
Realizing I&rsquo;m addicted<br>
to you now<br>
Come here baby<br>
relax and cool down<br>
What<br>
you saying<br>
Hit me back<br>
with the move now<br>
In my brain<br>
no one else<br>
It&rsquo;s just you<br>
now<br>
Let me love you<br>
the way<br>
That I do now<br>
I never knew how<br>
If we had the chance<br>
and the time to spend<br>
Would you do it again<br>
would you do it again<br>
Was it too much<br>
was it too much<br>
Now you&rsquo;re calling<br>
your friends<br>
Cuz I&rsquo;m gone again<br>
when I&rsquo;m back around<br>
Would you do it<br>
again<br>
Was it too much<br>
was it too much<br>
Was it<br>
too much<br>
Am I doing<br>
too much<br>
Do you understand<br>
my slang<br>
And get my sense<br>
of humor<br>
When<br>
your girlfriends<br>
Tell you I&rsquo;ve been<br>
freaking around<br>
Would you believe me<br>
if I told you<br>
They were lying and<br>
that&rsquo;s just a rumor<br>
Send you<br>
my personal driver<br>
Man this ain&rsquo;t<br>
just an Uber<br>
You know<br>
it&rsquo;s serious<br>
When you stay at mans<br>
ya bring a toothbrush<br>
Extra panties<br>
in your bag<br>
And<br>
some makeup remover<br>
You know<br>
I&rsquo;m hardly on my own<br>
&lsquo;Cause I stay<br>
with a shooter<br>
She call me daddy<br>
she&rsquo;s got issues<br>
I am not<br>
her father<br>
Hop off the boat<br>
into the jet<br>
Leave you<br>
at the harbor<br>
She injecting<br>
with Ozempic<br>
Try to stop<br>
her hunger<br>
Uh I wanked<br>
before you came<br>
So I can fxxx you<br>
longer<br>
S650<br>
chauffeur driven<br>
Just tap<br>
your address in<br>
Pack<br>
your bag<br>
And we can board<br>
the next flight<br>
We can<br>
check-in<br>
Make sure you<br>
check you<br>
Fill up<br>
your anti-depressants<br>
Before I fly<br>
you out again<br>
And you make me<br>
regret it<br>
It&rsquo;s that time<br>
pour it up<br>
And take one<br>
into the head<br>
Top down<br>
almost crashed<br>
Cuz I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo;<br>
at your texts<br>
Back and forth<br>
and Y mad<br>
About sxxx<br>
I never said<br>
Double text<br>
no reply<br>
But I know<br>
that you read it<br>
What<br>
you saying<br>
Hit me back<br>
with the move now<br>
In my brain<br>
no one else<br>
It&rsquo;s just you<br>
now<br>
Let me love you<br>
the way<br>
That I do now<br>
I never knew how<br>
If we had the chance<br>
and the time to spend<br>
Would you do it again<br>
would you do it again<br>
Was it too much<br>
was it too much<br>
Now you&rsquo;re calling<br>
your friends<br>
Cuz I&rsquo;m gone again<br>
when I&rsquo;m back around<br>
Would you do it<br>
again<br>
Was it too much<br>
was it too much<br>
Was it too much<br>
was it too much<br>
Was it too much<br>
was it too much</p>
