<p>Is it love tonight<br>
when everyone&rsquo;s<br>
Dreaming<br>
of a better life<br>
In this world<br>
divided by fear<br>
We&rsquo;ve gotta<br>
believe that<br>
There&rsquo;s a reason<br>
we&rsquo;re here<br>
Yeah there&rsquo;s a reason<br>
we&rsquo;re here oh yeah<br>
&lsquo;Cause these are<br>
the days worth livin&rsquo;<br>
These are the years<br>
we&rsquo;re given<br>
And these are<br>
the moments<br>
These are the times<br>
let&rsquo;s make the best<br>
Out of our lives<br>
see the truth<br>
All around<br>
our faith<br>
Can be broken<br>
and our hands<br>
Can be bound oh<br>
but open our hearts<br>
And fill up<br>
the emptiness<br>
With nothing<br>
to stop us<br>
Is it not<br>
worth the risk yeah<br>
Is it not<br>
worth the risk no yeah<br>
&lsquo;Cause these are<br>
the days worth livin&rsquo;<br>
These are the years<br>
we&rsquo;re given<br>
And these are<br>
the moments<br>
These are the times<br>
let&rsquo;s make the best<br>
Out of our lives<br>
even if hope<br>
Was shattered<br>
I know<br>
It wouldn&rsquo;t matter<br>
&lsquo;cause these are<br>
The moments<br>
these are the times<br>
Let&rsquo;s make the best<br>
out of our lives<br>
We can&rsquo;t go wrong<br>
thinking it&rsquo;s wrong<br>
To speak our minds<br>
I&rsquo;ve gotta let out<br>
What&rsquo;s inside<br>
Is it love tonight<br>
When everyone&rsquo;s<br>
dreaming<br>
But can we<br>
get it right<br>
Yeah but can we<br>
get it right<br>
&lsquo;Cause these are<br>
the days worth livin&rsquo;<br>
These are the years<br>
we&rsquo;re given<br>
And these are<br>
the moments<br>
These are the times<br>
let&rsquo;s make the best<br>
Out of our lives<br>
even if hope<br>
Was shattered<br>
I know<br>
It wouldn&rsquo;t matter<br>
&lsquo;cause these are<br>
The moments<br>
these are the times<br>
Let&rsquo;s make the best<br>
out of our lives<br>
Oh yeah<br>
let&rsquo;s make the best<br>
Out of our lives<br>
oh yeah<br>
Let&rsquo;s make the best<br>
out of our lives-</p>
