<p>Is it worth it can you<br>
even hear me standing<br>
With your spotlight<br>
on me not enough to<br>
Feed the hungry<br>
I&rsquo;m tired and I felt<br>
It for awhile now<br>
In this sea of lonely<br>
The taste of ink<br>
is getting old<br>
It&rsquo;s four o&rsquo;clock<br>
in the fucking morning<br>
Each day gets more and<br>
more like the last day<br>
Still I can see<br>
it coming<br>
While I&rsquo;m standing<br>
in the river drowning<br>
This could be<br>
my chance<br>
To break out this<br>
could be my chance<br>
To say goodbye at last<br>
it&rsquo;s finally over<br>
Couldn&rsquo;t take this<br>
town much longer<br>
Being half dead wasn&rsquo;t<br>
what I planned to be<br>
Now I&rsquo;m ready to be<br>
free so here I am it&rsquo;s<br>
In my hands<br>
and I&rsquo;ll savor every<br>
Moment of this So here<br>
I am alive at last<br>
And I&rsquo;ll savor every<br>
moment of this<br>
And won&rsquo;t you think<br>
I&rsquo;m pretty<br>
When I&rsquo;m standing top<br>
the bright lit city<br>
And I&rsquo;ll take your<br>
hand and pick you up<br>
And keep you there<br>
so you can see<br>
As long as you&rsquo;re<br>
alive and<br>
Care I promise<br>
I will take you there<br>
And we&rsquo;ll drink and<br>
dance the night away<br>
And we&rsquo;ll drink and<br>
dance the night away<br>
So here I am<br>
it&rsquo;s in my hands<br>
And I&rsquo;ll savor every<br>
moment of this so here<br>
I am alive at last and<br>
I&rsquo;ll savor every<br>
Moment Of this savor<br>
every moment of this</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re<br>
alive here I am I<br>
Promise I will take<br>
you there as long as<br>
You&rsquo;re alive here I am<br>
I promise I will take<br>
You there and won&rsquo;t<br>
you think I&rsquo;m pretty<br>
When I&rsquo;m standing top<br>
the bright lit city<br>
And I&rsquo;ll take your<br>
hand and pick you up<br>
And keep you there<br>
so you can see<br>
As long as you&rsquo;re<br>
alive and care I<br>
Promise I will take<br>
you there as long as<br>
You&rsquo;re alive And care<br>
I promise<br>
I will take you there<br>
So here I am it&rsquo;s<br>
In my hands And I&rsquo;ll<br>
savor every moment of<br>
This So here I am<br>
alive at last<br>
And I&rsquo;ll savor every<br>
moment of this<br>
Savor every moment<br>
of this savor<br>
Every moment<br>
of this</p>
