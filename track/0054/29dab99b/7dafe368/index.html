<p>Step one you say<br>
we need to talk<br>
He walks<br>
you say sit down<br>
It&rsquo;s just a talk<br>
he smiles politely<br>
Back at you<br>
you stare politely<br>
Right on through<br>
some sort of<br>
Window to your right<br>
as he goes left<br>
And you stay right<br>
between the lines of<br>
Fear and blame<br>
and you begin to<br>
Wonder why<br>
you came<br>
Where did I go wrong<br>
I lost a friend<br>
Somewhere along<br>
in the bitterness<br>
And I would have<br>
stayed up<br>
With you<br>
all night<br>
Had I known how<br>
to save a life</p>
<p>Let him know<br>
that you know best<br>
Cause after all<br>
you do know best<br>
Try to slip past<br>
his defense<br>
Without granting<br>
innocence<br>
Lay down a list of<br>
what is wrong<br>
The things you&rsquo;ve<br>
told him all along<br>
And pray to God<br>
he hears you<br>
And pray to God<br>
he hears you<br>
Where did I go wrong<br>
I lost a friend<br>
Somewhere along<br>
in the bitterness<br>
And I would have<br>
stayed up<br>
With you<br>
all night<br>
Had I known how<br>
to save a life<br>
As he begins to<br>
raise his voice<br>
You lower yours<br>
and grant him one<br>
Last choice<br>
drive until<br>
You lose the road<br>
or break with<br>
The ones<br>
you&rsquo;ve followed<br>
He will do one of<br>
two things<br>
He will admit to<br>
everything<br>
Or he&rsquo;ll say<br>
he&rsquo;s just<br>
Not the same<br>
and you&rsquo;ll begin to<br>
Wonder<br>
why you came<br>
Where did I go wrong<br>
I lost a friend<br>
Somewhere along<br>
in the bitterness<br>
And I would have<br>
stayed up<br>
With you<br>
all night<br>
Had I known how<br>
to save a life<br>
Where did I go wrong<br>
I lost a friend<br>
Somewhere along<br>
in the bitterness<br>
And I would have<br>
stayed up<br>
With you<br>
all night<br>
Had I known how<br>
to save a life<br>
How to save a life<br>
how to save a life<br>
Where did I go wrong<br>
I lost a friend<br>
Somewhere along<br>
in the bitterness<br>
And I would have<br>
stayed up<br>
With you<br>
all night<br>
Had I known how<br>
to save a life<br>
Where did I go wrong<br>
I lost a friend<br>
Somewhere along<br>
in the bitterness<br>
And I would have<br>
stayed up<br>
With you<br>
all night<br>
Had I known how<br>
to save a life<br>
How to save a life<br>
how to save a life</p>
