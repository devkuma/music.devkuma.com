<p>Hey girl you know<br>
you drive me crazy<br>
One look puts<br>
the rhythm in my head<br>
Still I&rsquo;ll never<br>
understand<br>
Why you<br>
hang around<br>
I see<br>
what&rsquo;s going down<br>
Cover up with makeup<br>
in the mirror<br>
Tell<br>
yourself<br>
It&rsquo;s never gonna<br>
happen again<br>
You cry alone and then<br>
he swears he loves you<br>
Do you feel<br>
like a man<br>
When you<br>
push her around?<br>
Do you feel<br>
better now<br>
As she falls<br>
to the ground?<br>
Well I&rsquo;ll tell you<br>
my friend<br>
One day this world&rsquo;s<br>
going to end<br>
As your lies<br>
crumble down<br>
A new life<br>
she has found<br>
A pebble in the water<br>
makes a ripple effect<br>
Every action<br>
in this world<br>
Will bear<br>
a consequence<br>
If you wade<br>
around forever<br>
You will<br>
surely drown<br>
I see<br>
what&rsquo;s going down<br>
I see<br>
the way you go and<br>
Say you&rsquo;re<br>
right again<br>
Say you&rsquo;re right again<br>
heed my lecture<br>
Do you feel<br>
like a man<br>
When you<br>
push her around?<br>
Do you feel<br>
better now<br>
As she falls<br>
to the ground?<br>
Well I&rsquo;ll tell you<br>
my friend<br>
One day this world&rsquo;s<br>
going to end<br>
As your lies<br>
crumble down<br>
A new life<br>
she has found<br>
Face down<br>
in the dirt<br>
She said<br>
this doesn&rsquo;t hurt<br>
She said<br>
I finally had enough<br>
Face down<br>
in the dirt<br>
She said<br>
this doesn&rsquo;t hurt<br>
She said<br>
I finally had enough<br>
One day<br>
she will tell you<br>
That she<br>
had enough<br>
It&rsquo;s coming<br>
round again<br>
Do you feel<br>
like a man<br>
When you<br>
push her around?<br>
Do you feel<br>
better now<br>
As she falls<br>
to the ground?<br>
Well I&rsquo;ll tell you<br>
my friend<br>
One day this world&rsquo;s<br>
going to end<br>
As your lies<br>
crumble down<br>
A new life<br>
she has found<br>
Do you feel<br>
like a man<br>
When you<br>
push her around?<br>
Do you feel<br>
better now<br>
As she falls<br>
to the ground?<br>
Well I&rsquo;ll tell you<br>
my friend<br>
One day this world&rsquo;s<br>
going to end<br>
As your lies<br>
crumble down<br>
A new life<br>
she has found<br>
Face down<br>
in the dirt<br>
She said<br>
this doesn&rsquo;t hurt<br>
She said<br>
I finally had enough</p>
