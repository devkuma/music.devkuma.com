<p>I was like peace<br>
in a groove<br>
On a sunday<br>
afternoon<br>
You were<br>
there so was<br>
I in the park<br>
4th of July<br>
I was chillin&rsquo;<br>
with my Kool Aid<br>
When Miss Chilli<br>
came to relay<br>
That you had<br>
a thang for me<br>
Finest thang<br>
you&rsquo;d ever seen<br>
I must admit to you<br>
I&rsquo;ve heard them<br>
Lines a time or two<br>
although<br>
For some apparent<br>
reason<br>
Monkey lines are<br>
now in season<br>
Lights off<br>
lights on<br>
I guess the groove<br>
is on so I am<br>
Diggin&rsquo; the scene<br>
Diggin&rsquo;on you<br>
Diggin&rsquo;on me<br>
baby bay ooo baby baby<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
it&rsquo;s on like that<br>
I gotta be in love or<br>
somethin&rsquo; like that<br>
Diggin&rsquo;the scene<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on you<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on me<br>
baby bay ooo baby baby<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
it&rsquo;s on like that<br>
I gotta be in love or<br>
somethin&rsquo; like that<br>
I was like<br>
deep in a cool<br>
What&rsquo;nt gone be<br>
nobody&rsquo;s fool<br>
Could not care less<br>
who was there<br>
Could&rsquo;ve been<br>
like anywhere<br>
I was chillin&rsquo;<br>
with my Kool Aid<br>
Did not want to<br>
par ti ci pate<br>
In nosilly<br>
conversations<br>
Had no time for<br>
new relation ships<br>
I must admit to you<br>
When I heard the<br>
Lines you threw<br>
although<br>
It usually<br>
turns me off<br>
But this time<br>
you have turned me on<br>
Lights off lights on<br>
I guess the groove is<br>
On and I am<br>
Diggin&rsquo; the scene<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on you<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on me<br>
Baby bay ooo<br>
baby baby<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
I gotta be in love or<br>
somethin&rsquo; like that<br>
Diggin&rsquo; the scene<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on you<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on me<br>
Baby bay ooo baby baby<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
I gotta be in love or<br>
somethin&rsquo; like that<br>
Oh why do<br>
I feel the way I do<br>
When all I can<br>
think about is you<br>
What was it<br>
in a line<br>
That made me<br>
fall for you<br>
Do you know<br>
Why I&rsquo;m diggin&rsquo;<br>
diggin&rsquo; diggin&rsquo;<br>
diggin&rsquo; on you</p>
<p>Diggin&rsquo; the scene<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
Diggin&rsquo; the scene<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on you<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on me<br>
baby bay ooo baby baby<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
I gotta be in love or<br>
somethin&rsquo; like that<br>
Diggin&rsquo; the scene<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on you<br>
Diggin&rsquo; on me<br>
baby bay ooo baby baby<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
It&rsquo;s on like that<br>
I gotta be in love or</p>
