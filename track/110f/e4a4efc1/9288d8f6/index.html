    <p>(Nine to five)</p>
<p>Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen<br>
Pour myself a cup of ambition<br>
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life<br>
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin&rsquo;<br>
Out on the street, the traffic&rsquo;s jumpin&rsquo;<br>
With folks like me on the job from nine to five(Mm, yeah)</p>
<p>Workin&rsquo; nine to five, what a way to make a livin&rsquo;<br>
Barely gettin&rsquo; by, it&rsquo;s all takin&rsquo; and no givin&rsquo;<br>
They just use your mind and they never give you credit<br>
It&rsquo;s enough to drive you crazy if you let it(If you let it)<br>
Workin&rsquo; nine to five for service and devotion<br>
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion<br>
Want to move ahead, but the boss won&rsquo;t seem to let me<br>
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me(He&rsquo;s out to get me)</p>

You&rsquo;re just a step on the boss man&rsquo;s ladder<br>
But you got dreams he&rsquo;ll never take away(He&rsquo;ll never take &rsquo;em away)<br>
You&rsquo;re in the same boat with a lot of your friends<br>
Waitin&rsquo; for the day your ship&rsquo;ll come in<br>
And then the tide&rsquo;s gonna turn and it&rsquo;s all gonna roll your way(I just roll away)</p>
<p>Workin&rsquo; nine to five, what a way to make a livin&rsquo;<br>
Barely gettin&rsquo; by, it&rsquo;s all takin&rsquo; and no givin&rsquo;<br>
They just use your mind and they never give you credit<br>
It&rsquo;s enough to drive you crazy if you let it(But you won&rsquo;t let it)<br>
Workin&rsquo; nine to five, yeah, they got you where they want you<br>
There&rsquo;s a better life and you dream about it, don&rsquo;t you?(You dream about it)<br>
It&rsquo;s a rich man&rsquo;s game no matter what they call it<br>
And you spend your life puttin&rsquo; money in his wallet(Puttin&rsquo; money in his wallet)<br>
