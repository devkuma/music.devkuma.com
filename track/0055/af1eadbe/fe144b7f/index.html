<p>Oh no no no no no<br>
no no no no no no woo-<br>
When U feel it<br>
in your body<br>
U found somebody who<br>
makes U change<br>
Your ways<br>
like hanging<br>
Wit your crew<br>
said U act<br>
Like U ready<br>
but U don&rsquo;t<br>
Really know<br>
and everything<br>
In your past<br>
U wanna let it go<br>
I been there<br>
done it humped around<br>
After all that<br>
this is what I found<br>
Nobody wants<br>
to be alone<br>
If you&rsquo;re touched<br>
by the words<br>
In this song<br>
then maybe<br>
U got it U got it bad<br>
when you&rsquo;re<br>
On the phone<br>
hang up and<br>
U call right back<br>
U got it U got it bad<br>
If U miss a day<br>
without your friend<br>
Your whole life&rsquo;s<br>
off track<br>
U know U got it bad<br>
when U stuck<br>
In the house<br>
U don&rsquo;t wanna have fun<br>
&lsquo;Cause all U<br>
think about<br>
U got it bad<br>
when you&rsquo;re out<br>
With someone<br>
but U keep on thinkin&rsquo;<br>
About somebody else<br>
U got it bad<br>
When U say<br>
that you love &rsquo;em<br>
And U really know<br>
everything that<br>
Use to matter<br>
don&rsquo;t matter no more<br>
Like my money<br>
all my cars<br>
(U can have<br>
it all and)<br>
Flowers, cards<br>
and candy<br>
(I do it<br>
just &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m)<br>
Said I&rsquo;m fortunate<br>
to have U girl<br>
I want U to know<br>
(I really adore U)<br>
All my people that<br>
know what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on<br>
Look at your mate<br>
help me sing my song<br>
Tell her I&rsquo;m your man<br>
you&rsquo;re my girl<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna tell it<br>
to the whole<br>
Wide world<br>
ladies say<br>
I&rsquo;m your girl<br>
you&rsquo;re my man<br>
Promise to love U<br>
the best I can<br>
See I&rsquo;ve been there<br>
done it humped around<br>
After all that<br>
this is what I found<br>
Every one of y&rsquo;all<br>
are just like me<br>
It&rsquo;s too bad<br>
that U can&rsquo;t see<br>
That U got it bad<br>
U got it U got it bad<br>
When you&rsquo;re<br>
on the phone<br>
Hang up and<br>
U call right back<br>
U got it U got it bad<br>
if U miss a day<br>
Without your friend<br>
your whole life&rsquo;s<br>
Off track<br>
U know U got it bad<br>
When U stuck<br>
in the house<br>
U don&rsquo;t wanna<br>
have fun<br>
&lsquo;Cause all U<br>
think about<br>
U got it bad<br>
when you&rsquo;re out<br>
With someone<br>
but U keep on thinkin&rsquo;<br>
About somebody else<br>
U got it bad-</p>
<p>U got it<br>
U got it bad<br>
When you&rsquo;re<br>
on the phone<br>
Hang up and<br>
U call right back<br>
U got it U got it bad<br>
if U miss a day<br>
Without your friend<br>
your whole life&rsquo;s<br>
Off track<br>
U know U got it bad<br>
When U stuck<br>
in the house<br>
U don&rsquo;t wanna<br>
have fun<br>
&lsquo;Cause all U<br>
think about<br>
U got it bad<br>
when you&rsquo;re out<br>
With someone<br>
