<p>All at once<br>
I finally<br>
Took a moment<br>
and I&rsquo;m realizing<br>
That you&rsquo;re not<br>
coming back<br>
And it finally hit me<br>
all at once<br>
All at once<br>
I started counting<br>
Teadrops and at least<br>
a million fell<br>
My eyes<br>
began to swell<br>
And all my dreams<br>
were shattered<br>
All at once<br>
ever since I met you<br>
You&rsquo;re the only love<br>
I&rsquo;ve known<br>
And I can&rsquo;t forget you<br>
so I must face it<br>
All alone<br>
all at once<br>
I&rsquo;m drifting<br>
on lonely sea<br>
Wishing you&rsquo;d<br>
come back to me<br>
And that&rsquo;s all<br>
that matters now<br>
All at once<br>
I&rsquo;m drifting<br>
On lonely sea holding<br>
on to memories<br>
And it hurts me more<br>
than you know<br>
So much more than<br>
it shows<br>
All at once<br>
all at once<br>
I looked around<br>
and found<br>
That you were<br>
with another one<br>
In someone else&rsquo;s arms<br>
and all my dreams<br>
Were shattered<br>
all at once<br>
All at once<br>
the smile that<br>
Used to great me<br>
brightened<br>
Someone else&rsquo;s day<br>
she took your<br>
Smile away<br>
and left me<br>
With just memories<br>
all at once<br>
Ever since I met you<br>
you&rsquo;re the only love<br>
I&rsquo;ve known<br>
and I can&rsquo;t forget you<br>
So I must face it<br>
all alone<br>
All at once<br>
I&rsquo;m drifting<br>
On lonely sea<br>
wishing you&rsquo;d<br>
Come back to me<br>
and that&rsquo;s all<br>
That matters now<br>
all at once<br>
I&rsquo;m drifting<br>
on lonely sea<br>
Holding on to memories<br>
and it hurts me<br>
More than you know<br>
so much more than<br>
It shows<br>
all at once<br>
All at once<br>
I&rsquo;m drifting<br>
On lonely sea<br>
wishing you&rsquo;d<br>
Come back to me<br>
and it hurts me<br>
More than you know<br>
so much more than<br>
It shows<br>
all at once<br>
And that&rsquo;s all<br>
that matters now<br>
All at once<br>
I&rsquo;m drifting<br>
On lonely sea<br>
wishing you&rsquo;d<br>
Come back to me<br>
and it hurts me<br>
More than you know<br>
all at once</p>
