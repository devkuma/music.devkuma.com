<p>I wanna know<br>
who ever told you<br>
I was letting go<br>
of the only joy<br>
That I<br>
have ever known<br>
Girl they were lying<br>
Just look around<br>
And all of the people<br>
that we used to know<br>
Have just given up<br>
they wanna let it go<br>
But we&rsquo;re<br>
still trying<br>
So you should know<br>
this love we<br>
Share was<br>
never made to die<br>
I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re on<br>
this one way<br>
Street just you and I<br>
just you and I<br>
I&rsquo;m never gonna<br>
say goodbye<br>
Cos I never<br>
wanna see you cry<br>
I swore to you my<br>
love would remain<br>
And I swear it all<br>
over again and I<br>
I&rsquo;m never gonna<br>
treat you bad<br>
Cos I never<br>
wanna see you sad<br>
I swore to share your<br>
joy and your pain<br>
And I swear it<br>
all over again<br>
All over again<br>
some people say<br>
That everything has<br>
got its place in time<br>
Even the day must<br>
give way to the night<br>
But I&rsquo;m not buying<br>
cos in your eyes<br>
I see a love that<br>
burns eternally<br>
And if you<br>
see how beautiful<br>
You are to me<br>
you&rsquo;ll know<br>
I&rsquo;m not lying<br>
sure there&rsquo;ll be<br>
Times we wanna<br>
say goodbye<br>
But even if we try<br>
there are some things<br>
In this life<br>
won&rsquo;t be denied<br>
Won&rsquo;t be denied<br>
I&rsquo;m never gonna<br>
Say goodbye<br>
cos I never<br>
Wanna see you cry<br>
I swore to you<br>
My love<br>
would remain<br>
And I swear it all<br>
over again and I<br>
I&rsquo;m never gonna<br>
treat you bad<br>
Cos I never<br>
wanna see you sad<br>
I swore to share your<br>
joy and your pain<br>
And I swear it<br>
all over again<br>
The more I<br>
know of you is<br>
The more I<br>
know I love you<br>
And the more that<br>
I&rsquo;m sure<br>
I want you forever<br>
and ever more<br>
And the more that<br>
you love me<br>
The more<br>
that I know<br>
Oh that I&rsquo;m never<br>
gonna let you go<br>
Gotta let you<br>
know that I<br>
I&rsquo;m never gonna<br>
say goodbye<br>
Cos I never<br>
wanna see you cry<br>
I swore to you my<br>
love would remain<br>
And I swear it all<br>
over again and I<br>
I&rsquo;m never gonna<br>
treat you bad<br>
Cos I never wanna<br>
see you sad<br>
I swore to share your<br>
joy and your pain<br>
And I swear it<br>
all over again<br>
All over again<br>
all over again<br>
And I swear it<br>
all over again</p>
