<p>Baby I know<br>
the story<br>
I&rsquo;ve seen the picture<br>
it&rsquo;s written all<br>
Over your face<br>
tell me what&rsquo;s<br>
The secret that<br>
you&rsquo;ve been hiding?<br>
And who&rsquo;s gonna<br>
take my place?<br>
I should have<br>
seen it coming<br>
I should have<br>
read the signs<br>
Anyway I guess<br>
it&rsquo;s over<br>
Can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I&rsquo;m the fool again<br>
I thought this love<br>
would never end<br>
How was I to know?<br>
you never told me<br>
Can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I&rsquo;m the fool again<br>
And I who thought you<br>
were my friend<br>
How was I to know?<br>
you never told me<br>
Baby you should&rsquo;ve<br>
called me<br>
When you were lonely<br>
when you<br>
Needed me to<br>
be there<br>
Sadly you<br>
never gave me<br>
Too many chances to<br>
show you<br>
How much I care<br>
oh should have<br>
Seen it coming<br>
I should have<br>
Read the signs<br>
anyway I guess<br>
It&rsquo;s over<br>
can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I&rsquo;m the fool again<br>
I thought this love<br>
Would never end<br>
how was I to know?<br>
You never told me<br>
Can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I&rsquo;m the fool again<br>
and I who thought<br>
You were my friend<br>
how was I to know?<br>
You never told me<br>
about the pain<br>
And the tears<br>
oh If I could<br>
I would turn<br>
back the time<br>
Oh yeah I should<br>
have seen it coming<br>
I should have<br>
read the signs<br>
Anyway I guess<br>
it&rsquo;s over<br>
Can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I&rsquo;m the fool again<br>
I thought this love<br>
would never end<br>
How was I to know?<br>
you never told me<br>
Can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I&rsquo;m the fool again<br>
And I who thought you<br>
were my friend<br>
How was I to know?<br>
you never told me<br>
Can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I&rsquo;m the fool again<br>
I thought this love<br>
would never end<br>
How was I to know?<br>
you never told me<br>
Can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I&rsquo;m the fool again<br>
And I who thought<br>
you were my friend<br>
How was I to know?<br>
you never told me<br>
Can&rsquo;t believe that<br>
I&rsquo;m the fool again</p>
