Hard like<br>

Delorian&rsquo;s doors<br>
Will he survive?<br>

I don&rsquo;t<br>
think<br>
I&rsquo;mma ever<br>
rest in peace<br>
I&rsquo;mma kill<br>
the game<br>
Leave the<br>

Tell a<br>
jealous chicken<br>
I don&rsquo;t know<br>
what the beef is<br>
I&rsquo;m just<br>
making money<br>
For my<br>
grandkids&rsquo; nieces<br>
I&rsquo;mma work hard<br>
that&rsquo;s my basis<br>
This beat is a xhit<br>
feces<br>
Pardon me ma&rsquo;am<br>
I&rsquo;mma go dumb<br>
Smart.I.am I&rsquo;m<br>
complicated hard.I.am<br>
I end the beginning<br>
then start it again<br>

You can get a curse<br>
you can get a cross<br>
You can go to work<br>
or you can be the boss<br>
I&rsquo;mma be the owner<br>

I&rsquo;mma go hard like a<br>
motherxuckin&rsquo; boner<br>
I&rsquo;mma make<br>
the beat put<br>
The people<br>
in a coma<br>
You can be a geek<br>
or be a rolling stoner<br>
I woke up<br>
in the morning<br>
Hard like morning wood<br>
in the morning<br>
Woke up thinking about<br>
microphoning<br>
E.T. on the mic<br>
phone the homeland<br>
I wait out like<br>
NASA<br>
I&rsquo;m way over here<br>
I done passed<br>
I get stacks of cash<br>

I go hard<br>
statues<br>
You can go hard<br>
or you can go home<br>
You can go hard or<br>

Now let me take<br>
this time to say<br>

Well I I know<br>

I don&rsquo;t wanna<br>

You can go hard<br>
or you can go home<br>
You can go<br>

Wait a<br>
minute<br>

little harder<br>
I&rsquo;mma make it a<br>
little harder<br>
Give it to you a<br>
little harder<br>
This is<br>
hard</p>
<p>Hard like a<br>
rock n roll<br>
Time bombs tickin&rsquo;<br>
explode<br>
Vivid as a<br>
dynamo<br>
Better move back now<br>
it&rsquo;s &lsquo;bout to blow<br>
Hard like geometry<br>
trigonometry<br>
This is crazy<br>
psychology<br>
Get it baby<br>
I&rsquo;m &lsquo;bout to win<br>
Watch out now<br>
I&rsquo;m going in<br>
You can go hard<br>
or you can go home<br>
You can go<br>
