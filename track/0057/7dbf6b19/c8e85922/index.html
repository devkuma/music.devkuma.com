<p>Here come<br>
the men in black<br>
It&rsquo;s the M.I.B&rsquo;s<br>
uh here come<br>
The M.I.B&rsquo;s<br>
here come<br>
The men in black<br>
they won&rsquo;t let<br>
You remember<br>
na na na<br>
The good guys dress<br>
in black remember that<br>
Just in case<br>
we ever face to face<br>
And make contact<br>
the title held<br>
By me M.I.B<br>
means what you think<br>
You saw you did not<br>
see so don&rsquo;t blink be<br>
What was there<br>
is now gone black suit<br>
With the black<br>
ray ban&rsquo;s on<br>
Walk in shadow move<br>
in silence<br>
Guard against<br>
extra-terrestrial<br>
Violence<br>
but yo we ain&rsquo;t<br>
On no government list<br>
we straight don&rsquo;t exist<br>
No names and<br>
no figerprints<br>
Saw somethin strange<br>
watch your back<br>
Cause you<br>
never quite know<br>
Where the M.I.B&rsquo;s<br>
is at uh and<br>
Here come the men<br>
in black (men in black)<br>
Galaxy defenders<br>
here come the men<br>
In black (men in black)<br>
they won&rsquo;t<br>
Let you remember<br>
uh uh uh uh now<br>
From the deepest<br>
of the darkest of night<br>
On the horizon<br>
bright light enters<br>
Sight tight<br>
cameras zoom<br>
On the impending doom<br>
but then like boom<br>
Black suits fill<br>
the room up<br>
With the quickness talk<br>
with the witnesses<br>
Hypnotizer neuralizer<br>
vivid memories turn<br>
To fantasies<br>
ain&rsquo;t no M.I.B&rsquo;s<br>
Can I please<br>
do what we say that&rsquo;s<br>
The way we kick it<br>
yanawhaimean<br>
I see my noisy cricket<br>
get wicked on ya<br>
We&rsquo;re your first<br>
last and only<br>
Line of defense<br>
against the worst scum<br>
Of the universe So<br>
don&rsquo;t fear us cheer us<br>
If you ever get<br>
near us don&rsquo;t jeer us<br>
We&rsquo;re the fearless<br>
M.I.B&rsquo;s freezin up<br>
All the flack<br>
(What&rsquo;s that stand for)<br>
Men In black<br>
uh m<br>
The men in black<br>

Just bounce it with me<br>

Imposin but trust me if<br>
