<p>There was a time<br>
when I couldn&rsquo;t<br>
Stop loving you<br>
so much<br>
Haven&rsquo;t seen that me<br>
for so long<br>
Forgot<br>
I shouldn&rsquo;t care<br>
I sang dum di di<br>
who I used to be<br>
Is not who I am<br>
look at me<br>
These dreams<br>
of mine<br>
Do not need<br>
your advice<br>
Or cheap<br>
blessing<br>
Here&rsquo;s my crown<br>
you couldn&rsquo;t lift<br>
You want me to act<br>
a certain way<br>
I&rsquo;m no one&rsquo;s toy<br>
no more<br>
It hurts them<br>
to know<br>
They can&rsquo;t control me<br>
each day<br>
Enjoy<br>
the pain<br>
I don&rsquo;t need<br>
your expectations<br>
Made the bricks<br>
to pave my way<br>
Fxxx that<br>
Grammy nomination<br>
Happiness cannot<br>
be bought<br>
One<br>
summer day<br>
We just might meet up<br>
again<br>
Hey<br>
look at you<br>
Sitting here<br>
all on your own<br>
Lost<br>
in your expectations<br>
I can&rsquo;t help you<br>
with that<br>
I can&rsquo;t ever hate you<br>
but had to let you go<br>
Changing myself<br>
for your ego<br>
And selfish pride<br>
stops there<br>
I sang Karate<br>
who I used to be<br>
Is not who I am<br>
look at me<br>
These dreams<br>
of mine<br>
Do not need<br>
your advice<br>
Or cheap<br>
blessing<br>
Here&rsquo;s my crown<br>
you couldn&rsquo;t lift<br>
You want me to act<br>
a certain way<br>
I&rsquo;m no one&rsquo;s toy<br>
no more<br>
It hurts them<br>
to know<br>
They can&rsquo;t control me<br>
each day<br>
Enjoy<br>
the pain<br>
I don&rsquo;t need<br>
your expectations<br>
Made the bricks<br>
to pave my way<br>
Fxxx that<br>
Grammy nomination<br>
Happiness cannot<br>
be bought<br>
One<br>
summer day<br>
We just might meet up<br>
again<br>
Hey<br>
look at you<br>
Sitting here<br>
all on your own<br>
Lost<br>
in your expectations<br>
I can&rsquo;t help you<br>
with that<br>
I can&rsquo;t lie<br>
say it was easy<br>
Each day alone<br>
filled me with fear<br>
But here I stand tall<br>
my face to the crowd<br>
I don&rsquo;t need<br>
your expectations<br>
Made the bricks<br>
to pave my way<br>
Fxxx that<br>
Grammy nomination<br>
Happiness cannot<br>
be bought<br>
One<br>
summer day<br>
We just might meet up<br>
again<br>
Hey<br>
look at you<br>
Sitting here<br>
all on your own<br>
Lost<br>
in your expectations<br>
I can&rsquo;t help you<br>
with that</p>
