<p>An old man turned<br>
ninety eight<br>
He won the lottery<br>
and died the next day<br>
It&rsquo;s a black fly<br>
in your Chardonnay<br>
It&rsquo;s a death<br>
row pardon<br>
Two minutes<br>
too late<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it ironic<br>
don&rsquo;t you think<br>
It&rsquo;s like rain<br>
on your wedding day<br>
It&rsquo;s a free ride<br>
when you&rsquo;ve<br>
Already paid<br>
it&rsquo;s the good advice<br>
That you just<br>
didn&rsquo;t take<br>
And who would&rsquo;ve<br>
thought it figures<br>
Mr. Play It Safe<br>
was afraid to fly<br>
He packed<br>
his suitcase<br>
And kissed<br>
his kids goodbye<br>
He waited his<br>
whole damn life<br>
To take that flight<br>
and as the plane<br>
Crashed down<br>
he thought<br>
Well isn&rsquo;t this nice<br>
and isn&rsquo;t it ironic<br>
Don&rsquo;t you think<br>
it&rsquo;s like rain<br>
On your wedding day<br>
it&rsquo;s a free ride<br>
When you&rsquo;ve<br>
already paid<br>
It&rsquo;s the good<br>
advice<br>
That you just<br>
didn&rsquo;t take<br>
And who would&rsquo;ve<br>
thought it figures<br>
Well life has<br>
a funny way<br>
Of sneaking up<br>
on you<br>
When you think<br>
everything&rsquo;s okay<br>
And everything&rsquo;s<br>
going right<br>
And life has<br>
a funny way<br>
Of helping you out<br>
when you think<br>
Everything&rsquo;s<br>
gone wrong<br>
And everything<br>
blows up In your face<br>
A traffic jam<br>
when you&rsquo;re<br>
Already late<br>
a no smoking<br>
Sign on your<br>
cigarette break<br>
It&rsquo;s like<br>
ten thousand spoons<br>
When all you<br>
need is a knife<br>
It&rsquo;s meeting<br>
the man of my dreams<br>
And then meeting<br>
his beautiful wife<br>
And isn&rsquo;t it ironic<br>
don&rsquo;t you think<br>
A little too ironic<br>
yeah I really do think<br>
It&rsquo;s like rain<br>
on your wedding day<br>
It&rsquo;s a free ride<br>
when you&rsquo;ve<br>
Already paid<br>
it&rsquo;s the good advice<br>
That you just<br>
didn&rsquo;t take<br>
And who would&rsquo;ve<br>
thought it figures<br>
Life has a funny way<br>
of sneaking up on you<br>
Life has<br>
a funny funny way<br>
Of helping you out<br>
helping you out</p>
