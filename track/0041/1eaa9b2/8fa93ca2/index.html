<hr>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s laughin&rsquo; at me<br>
But not like they used to<br>
The room&rsquo;s spinnin&rsquo; all around me<br>
But not like I&rsquo;m used to<br>
Hired hired<br>
Can I get hired?<br>
I got no skills except gettin&rsquo; high<br>
I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; tryin&rsquo;<br>
I can start Friday<br>
You&rsquo;ve wasted your life but thanks for applying<br>
Hey now hold up we were fun as hell<br>
I&rsquo;m all grown up but you couldn&rsquo;t tell<br>
Now I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself<br>
(Da da da da da da da)<br>
You got older &lsquo;cause you good at life<br>
I&rsquo;m all seventeen at thirty five<br>
Now I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s anything else<br>
The DJ is cryin&rsquo; for help(Oh oh oh)<br>
The DJ is cryin&rsquo; for help(Oh oh oh)<br>
Don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself<br>
Hey now hold up we were fun as hell<br>
I&rsquo;m all grown up but you couldn&rsquo;t tell<br>
Now I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself<br>
The DJ is crying for help<br>
Everyone&rsquo;s trippin&rsquo; on pills<br>
But now they&rsquo;re prescribed too<br>
And everyone&rsquo;s stackin&rsquo; their bills<br>
But not &lsquo;cause they like to<br>
Oh hired hired<br>
Can I get hired?<br>
Yeah I fucked up but I did it my way<br>
Tryin&rsquo; tryin&rsquo;<br>
I could start Friday<br>
Gettin&rsquo; a life&rsquo;s a little like dyin&rsquo;<br>
Hey now hold up we were fun as hell<br>
I&rsquo;m all grown up but you couldn&rsquo;t tell<br>
Now I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself<br>
(Da da da da da da da)<br>
You got older &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re good at life<br>
I&rsquo;m all seventeen at thirty five<br>
Now I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s anything else<br>
The DJ is cryin&rsquo; for help(Don&rsquo;t leave me out)<br>
The DJ is cryin&rsquo; for help(Don&rsquo;t leave me out)<br>
Don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself<br>
Hey now hold up we were fun as hell<br>
I&rsquo;m all grown up but you couldn&rsquo;t tell<br>
Now I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself<br>
The DJ is cryin&rsquo; for help<br>
You got older &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re good at life<br>
(Don&rsquo;t leave me out)<br>
I&rsquo;m all seventeen at thirty five<br>
Now I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s anything else<br>
The DJ is crying for help<br>
And now I&rsquo;m all(I&rsquo;m all) alone(Alone)<br>
Waitin&rsquo; for the beat to drop<br>
Be kind to me be kind and wait it out<br>
And now I&rsquo;m all(I&rsquo;m all) alone(Alone)<br>
Waitin&rsquo; &rsquo;til the party starts<br>
Be kind to me be kind and wait it out<br>
And now I&rsquo;m all alone<br>
Waitin&rsquo; &rsquo;til the party starts</p>
