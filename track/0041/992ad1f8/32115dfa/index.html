<p>I looked<br>
in my rear-view mirror<br>
And it seemed to make<br>
a lot more sense<br>
Than<br>
what I see<br>
Ahead of us<br>
ahead of us<br>
I&rsquo;m ready<br>
to make that turn<br>
Before we both<br>
crash and burn<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
that could be<br>
The death of us<br>
the death of us<br>
Baby you know<br>
how to drive in rain<br>
And you decided not<br>
to make a change<br>
Stuck<br>
in the same old lane<br>
Going<br>
the wrong way home<br>
I feel<br>
like my heart is stuck<br>
In bumper-to-bumper<br>
traffic<br>
I&rsquo;m under<br>
pressure<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
I can&rsquo;t have you<br>
The way<br>
that I want<br>
Let&rsquo;s just go back<br>
to the way it was<br>
When<br>
we were<br>
On honeymoon Avenue<br>
honeymoon Avenue<br>
Baby<br>
coastin&rsquo; like crazy<br>
Can we get back<br>
to the way it was<br>
Hey what happened<br>
to the butterflies<br>
Guess they encountered<br>
that stop sign<br>
And<br>
my heart is<br>
At a yellow light<br>
a yellow light<br>
Hey right when I think<br>
that we found it<br>
Well that&rsquo;s when we<br>
start turning around<br>
You&rsquo;re saying<br>
baby don&rsquo;t worry<br>
But we&rsquo;re still going<br>
the wrong way<br>
Baby you know<br>
how to drive in rain<br>
And you decided not<br>
to make a change<br>
Stuck<br>
in the same old lane<br>
Going<br>
the wrong way home<br>
I feel<br>
like my heart is stuck<br>
In bumper-to-bumper<br>
traffic<br>
I&rsquo;m under<br>
pressure<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
I can&rsquo;t have you<br>
The way<br>
that I want<br>
Let&rsquo;s just go back<br>
to the way it was<br>
When<br>
we were<br>
On honeymoon Avenue<br>
honeymoon Avenue<br>
Baby<br>
coastin&rsquo; like crazy<br>
Can we get back<br>
to the way it was<br>
They say only fools<br>
fall in love<br>
Well they must&rsquo;ve been<br>
talking about us<br>
And<br>
sometimes I feel<br>
Like<br>
I&rsquo;ve been here before<br>
I could be wrong<br>
but I know I&rsquo;m right<br>
We gon&rsquo;<br>
be lost<br>
If we continue<br>
to fight<br>
Honey<br>
I know<br>
We can find<br>
our way home<br>
I feel<br>
like my heart is stuck<br>
In bumper-to-bumper<br>
traffic<br>
I&rsquo;m under<br>
pressure<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
I can&rsquo;t have you<br>
The way<br>
that I want<br>
Let&rsquo;s just go back<br>
to the way it was<br>
When<br>
we were<br>
On honeymoon Avenue<br>
honeymoon Avenue<br>
My baby<br>
coastin&rsquo; like crazy<br>
Can we get back<br>
to the way it was<br>
When<br>
we were<br>
On honeymoon Avenue<br>
honeymoon Avenue<br>
Baby<br>
coastin&rsquo; like crazy<br>
Can we get back<br>
to the way it was<br>
Baby you know<br>
how to drive in rain<br>
You decided not<br>
to make a change<br>
Stuck<br>
in the same old lane<br>
Going<br>
the wrong way home<br>
I feel like my heart<br>
is stuck in traffic<br>
I&rsquo;m under pressure<br>
pressure<br>
Pressure<br>
pressure<br>
Let&rsquo;s just go back<br>
to the way it was<br>
When<br>
we were<br>
On honeymoon Avenue<br>
honeymoon Avenue<br>
Honeymoon<br>
Avenue<br>
Honeymoon Avenue<br>
Avenue<br>
Let&rsquo;s just go back<br>
back back</p>
