<p>Legends on<br>
three two one<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m goated<br>
goated goated<br>
Goated goated<br>
goated please<br>
Please don&rsquo;t go there<br>
go there go there<br>
Go there go there<br>
with me<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m goated<br>
goated goated<br>
Goated goated goated<br>
goated goated goated<br>
Barely even got enough<br>
change in the meter<br>
Double parked looking<br>
like Bane in a beater<br>
Her friend keep<br>
helpin&rsquo;<br>
Detangle<br>
the weave<br>
Only jumped<br>
in the front<br>
Seat to play<br>
with the speakers<br>
Stuck to my plans<br>
stretchin&rsquo; my bands<br>
Plus when I stomp<br>
in my customized vans<br>
Crush like<br>
rush life<br>
Plus I got &rsquo;em<br>
all plus size<br>
Panamera truck<br>
I hop out the roof<br>
Yeah<br>
dime on my left wrist<br>
And she got the flu<br>
yeah<br>
Watch look<br>
like Chex mix<br>
It&rsquo;s &lsquo;posed to be blue<br>
huh<br>
She know<br>
it&rsquo;s two seat<br>
So she leave<br>
her best friends<br>
Bust down<br>
my dad face<br>
Your chain is<br>
a necklace<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m goated<br>
goated goated<br>
Goated goated<br>
goated please<br>
Please don&rsquo;t go there<br>
go there go there<br>
Go there go there<br>
go there with me<br>
Left wrist golden<br>
right wrist golden<br>
Necklace golden<br>
yes it&rsquo;s golden<br>
Please don&rsquo;t go there<br>
go there go there<br>
Go there go there<br>
go there with me<br>
I had to hit<br>
my designer for sneaks<br>
Double-dip mine<br>
in the bleach<br>
I&rsquo;m blanco<br>
for sure<br>
If I&rsquo;m poppin&rsquo; down<br>
Miami Beach<br>
Pull like Lebron<br>
with the Heat huh<br>
I bought a crib<br>
in a crib<br>
With a office chair<br>
beach half a mile<br>
But I can&rsquo;t see me<br>
walking there<br>
I whip<br>
a Tesla<br>
But it ain&rsquo;t<br>
no charger there<br>
I call up<br>
Co and Brianna<br>
And park it there<br>
top heat box seats<br>
I&rsquo;m watching<br>
Archer there<br>
Cop lights stop<br>
right next<br>
Where my block<br>
at trust fall<br>
Beat I might drop that<br>
hips on Thee Stallion<br>
And Doja her top half<br>
twenty-three hundred<br>
On the horse<br>
and I&rsquo;m Michael<br>
Switchin&rsquo;<br>
out the character<br>
The strip is<br>
like typos<br>
Legends on<br>
three two one<br>
You tried it<br>
you say you love me<br>
Like you love him<br>
you lying<br>
You know your worth<br>
for what it&rsquo;s worth<br>
I could<br>
buy it<br>
Would say it&rsquo;s lonely<br>
at the top<br>
But<br>
I&rsquo;m biased<br>
Because<br>
I&rsquo;m only at the top<br>
But you tried it<br>
you say you love me<br>
Like you love him<br>
you lying<br>
You know your worth<br>
for what it&rsquo;s worth<br>
I could<br>
buy it<br>
Would say it&rsquo;s lonely<br>
at the top<br>
But I&rsquo;m biased<br>
okay I have reloaded<br>
Bxxxx I&rsquo;m goated<br>
walk on this beat<br>
Like I&rsquo;m walking<br>
to Poland<br>
Got Glocks<br>
that I&rsquo;m holdin&rsquo; it<br>
And guap<br>
that I&rsquo;m throwing<br>
Hoes gon&rsquo; love a nxxxx<br>
in some Rick Owens<br>
And different color<br>
diamonds<br>
Like<br>
I&rsquo;m Josh Brolin<br>
How many times<br>
can I tell you<br>
I&rsquo;m<br>
goated<br>
How many times<br>
can I tell you<br>
I&rsquo;m<br>
goated<br>
How many times<br>
can I tell you<br>
I&rsquo;m goated<br>
without nxxxxx actin&rsquo;<br>
Like<br>
they don&rsquo;t know it<br>
Why sir<br>
see every year<br>
I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; better<br>
as a writer<br>
And when it comes down<br>
to the flow<br>
I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; nicer<br>
and nxxxxx couldn&rsquo;t<br>
Name a song<br>
but a cypher<br>
It dosen&rsquo;t<br>
matter<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m still<br>
gettin&rsquo; money though<br>
Only reason<br>
why you hatin&rsquo; is<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
your money low<br>
And every<br>
hundred thousand<br>
There&rsquo;s<br>
a hundred hoes<br>
When niggas see you<br>
as a G.O.A.T.<br>
That&rsquo;s just<br>
how it goes<br>
Nxxxxx don&rsquo;t wanna<br>
see you do great<br>
Rather<br>
they see you fall off<br>
And then watch<br>
your whole ego deflate<br>
Don&rsquo;t give a dxxx<br>
what you make<br>
I see<br>
the jealousy<br>
Boy that&rsquo;s<br>
a horrible trait<br>
I spot the hate<br>
no binoculars<br>
This how it feels<br>
to be popular<br>
They sendin&rsquo; shots<br>
no photographer<br>
Don&rsquo;t<br>
give a dxxx<br>
