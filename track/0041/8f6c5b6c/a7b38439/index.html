    <p>작곡: Sung by / 작사: Kara DioGuardi, Ashlee Simpson, John Shanks<br>

<p>I was<br>
six years old<br>
When my parents<br>
went away<br>
I was stuck inside<br>
a broken life<br>
I couldn&rsquo;t wish away<br>
she was beautiful<br>
She had everything<br>
and more<br>
And my escape<br>
was hiding out<br>
And running<br>
for the door<br>
Somebody listen please<br>
it used to be<br>
So hard being me<br>
living in the shadow<br>
Of someone else&rsquo;s<br>
dream<br>
Trying to find<br>
a hand to hold<br>
But every touch<br>
felt cold to me<br>
Living in a nightmare<br>
a never ending sleep<br>
But now that<br>
I am wide awake<br>
My chains are<br>
finally free<br>
Don&rsquo;t feel sorry<br>
for me<br>
All the days collided<br>
one less perfect<br>
Than the next<br>
I was stuck inside<br>
Someone else&rsquo;s life<br>
and always second best<br>
Oh I love you now<br>
cause now I realize<br>
That it&rsquo;s safe outside<br>
to come alive<br>
In my identity<br>
so if you&rsquo;re listening<br>
There&rsquo;s so much more<br>
to me<br>
You haven&rsquo;t seen<br>
living in the shadow<br>
Of someone else&rsquo;s<br>
dream<br>
Trying to find<br>
a hand to hold<br>
But every touch<br>
felt cold to me<br>
Living in a nightmare<br>
a never ending sleep<br>
But now that<br>
I am wide awake<br>
Then I can<br>
finally see<br>
Don&rsquo;t feel sorry<br>
for me<br>
Mother sister father<br>
sister mother<br>
Everything&rsquo;s cool now<br>
mother sister father<br>
Sister mother<br>
everything&rsquo;s cool now<br>
Oh my life is good<br>
I&rsquo;ve got more than<br>
Anyone should<br>
oh my life is good<br>
And the past is<br>
in the past<br>
I was living<br>
in the shadow<br>
Of someone else&rsquo;s<br>
dream<br>
Trying to find<br>
a hand to hold<br>
But every touch<br>
felt cold to me<br>
I&rsquo;m living<br>
in a new day<br>
I&rsquo;m living it for me<br>
and now that<br>
I am wide awake<br>
yeah I can finally be<br>
So don&rsquo;t feel sorry<br>
for me<br>
Don&rsquo;t feel sorry<br>
don&rsquo;t feel sorry<br>
For me<br>
don&rsquo;t feel sorry<br>
Don&rsquo;t feel sorry<br>
for me<br>
Living in living in<br>
living in the shadow<br>
Living in living in<br>
living in a new day</p>
