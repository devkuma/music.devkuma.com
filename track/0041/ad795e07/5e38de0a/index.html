<p>There&rsquo;s a fire<br>
starting in my heart<br>
Reaching a fever<br>
pitch and<br>
It&rsquo;s bring me<br>
out the dark<br>
Finally I can see you<br>
crystal clear<br>
Go ahead and<br>
sell me out<br>
And I&rsquo;ll lay your<br>
sheet bare<br>
See how<br>
I&rsquo;ll leave<br>
With every<br>
piece of you<br>
Don&rsquo;t underestimate<br>
the things<br>
That I<br>
will do<br>
There&rsquo;s a fire<br>
starting in my heart<br>
Reaching a fever<br>
pitch and<br>
It&rsquo;s bring me<br>
out the dark<br>
The scars of your love<br>
remind me of us<br>
They keep me<br>
thinking that<br>
We almost<br>
had it all<br>
The scars<br>
of your love<br>
They leave me<br>
breathless<br>
I can&rsquo;t<br>
help feeling<br>
We could have<br>
had it all<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
you never had met me<br>
Rolling<br>
in the deep<br>
Tears are gonna fall<br>
rolling in the deep<br>
You had<br>
my heart inside<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
(of your hands)<br>
You never<br>
had met me<br>
And you<br>
played it<br>
Tears are gonna fall<br>
(to the beat)<br>
Rolling<br>
in the deep<br>
Baby I have no<br>
story to be told<br>
But I&rsquo;ve heard<br>
one on you<br>
And I&rsquo;m gonna make<br>
your head burn<br>
Think of me<br>
in the depths<br>
Of your<br>
despair<br>
Make a home down<br>
there as mine<br>
Sure won&rsquo;t<br>
be shared<br>
The scars of your love<br>
remind me of us<br>
They keep me<br>
thinking<br>
That we almost<br>
had it all<br>
The scars of<br>
your love<br>
They leave me<br>
breathless<br>
I can&rsquo;t help<br>
feeling<br>
We could have<br>
had it all<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
you never had met me<br>
Rolling<br>
in the deep<br>
Tears are gonna fall<br>
rolling in the deep<br>
You had<br>
my heart inside<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
(of your hands)<br>
You never<br>
had met me<br>
And you<br>
played it<br>
Tears are gonna fall<br>
(to the beat)<br>
Rolling<br>
in the deep<br>
Could have<br>
had it all<br>
Rolling<br>
in the deep<br>
You had my heart<br>
inside of your hands<br>
But you played it<br>
with a beating<br>
Throw your soul<br>
through<br>
Every<br>
open door<br>
Count your blessings<br>
to find<br>
What you<br>
look for<br>
Turn my sorrow into<br>
treasured gold<br>
You&rsquo;ll pay me back<br>
in kind and<br>
Reap just<br>
what you&rsquo;ve sown<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
you never had met me<br>
We could have<br>
had it all<br>
Tears are gonna fall<br>
rolling in the deep<br>
We could have<br>
had it all<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
you never had met me<br>
It all<br>
it all it all<br>
We could have<br>
had it all<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
you never had met me<br>
Rolling<br>
in the deep<br>
Tears are gonna fall<br>
rolling in the deep<br>
You had<br>
my heart inside<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
(of your hands)<br>
You never<br>
had met me<br>
And you<br>
played it<br>
Tears are gonna fall<br>
(to the beat)<br>
Rolling<br>
in the deep<br>
Could have<br>
had it all<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
you never had met me<br>
Rolling<br>
in the deep<br>
Tears are gonna fall<br>
rolling in the deep<br>
You had<br>
my heart inside<br>
You&rsquo;re gonna wish<br>
(of your hands)<br>
You never<br>
had met me<br>
But you played it<br>
you played it<br>
You played it<br>
you played it<br>
To<br>
the beat</p>
