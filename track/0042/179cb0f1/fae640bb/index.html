<p>You try to read me<br>
you try to figure out<br>
You try to breathe me<br>
but you can&rsquo;t<br>
Blow me out<br>
you try to feel me<br>
But I&rsquo;m so<br>
out of touch<br>
I won&rsquo;t be falling<br>
you won&rsquo;t have<br>
To pick me up sorry<br>
if I sound confused<br>
And don&rsquo;t feel<br>
the way you do<br>
But I won&rsquo;t<br>
turn around<br>
But I won&rsquo;t<br>
turn around<br>
Think that<br>
I might back<br>
Down but I won&rsquo;t<br>
think that<br>
I might have<br>
doubts but I don&rsquo;t<br>
No insecurities<br>
won&rsquo;t you just<br>
Let me let me be<br>
think that<br>
You know me<br>
now but you don&rsquo;t<br>
Think that I I can&rsquo;t<br>
stand on my own<br>
Ain&rsquo;t my philosophy<br>
won&rsquo;t you just<br>
Let me let me be<br>
trust in my instincts<br>
Trust that I know<br>
what&rsquo;s right<br>
These are the reasons<br>
that keep you<br>
Up at night<br>
tell me go slow<br>
This is my flow<br>
&lsquo;cause you don&rsquo;t know<br>
Know what I know<br>
let me tell you<br>
How it feels<br>
baby its time<br>
That you&rsquo;ve seen me<br>
for real<br>
Sorry if<br>
I sound confused<br>
And don&rsquo;t feel<br>
the way you do<br>
But I won&rsquo;t<br>
turn around<br>
But I won&rsquo;t<br>
turn around<br>
Think that<br>
I might back<br>
Down but I won&rsquo;t<br>
think that<br>
I might have<br>
doubts but I don&rsquo;t<br>
No insecurities<br>
won&rsquo;t you just<br>
Let me let me be<br>
think that<br>
You know me<br>
now but you don&rsquo;t<br>
Think that I I can&rsquo;t<br>
stand on my own<br>
Ain&rsquo;t my philosophy<br>
won&rsquo;t you just<br>
Let me let me be<br>
trust that I know<br>
This is my show<br>
letting you know<br>
Gotta go the way I go<br>
trust that I know<br>
This is my show<br>
letting you know<br>
Gotta go<br>
the way I go<br>
Think that<br>
I might back<br>
Down but I won&rsquo;t<br>
think that<br>
I might have<br>
doubts but I don&rsquo;t<br>
No insecurities<br>
won&rsquo;t you just<br>
