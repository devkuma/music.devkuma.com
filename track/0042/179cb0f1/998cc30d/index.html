<p>You tell me<br>
you&rsquo;re in love with me<br>
That you can&rsquo;t<br>
take your pretty eyes<br>
Away from me<br>
it&rsquo;s not that<br>
I don&rsquo;t want to stay<br>
but everytime<br>
You come too close<br>
I move away<br>
I wanna believe in<br>
everything<br>
That you say ah cuz<br>
it sounds so good<br>
But if you really<br>
want me move it slow<br>
There&rsquo;s things<br>
about me<br>
You just have to know<br>
sometimes I run<br>
Sometimes I hide<br>
sometimes<br>
I&rsquo;m scared of you<br>
but all I really want<br>
Is to hold you tight<br>
treat you right<br>
Be with you<br>
day and night<br>
Baby all I need<br>
is time<br>
I don&rsquo;t wanna be<br>
so shy uh-uh<br>
Everytime that<br>
I&rsquo;m alone I wonder why<br>
Hope that<br>
you will wait for me<br>
You&rsquo;ll see that<br>
you&rsquo;re the only one<br>
For me<br>
I wanna believe in<br>
Everything that<br>
you say ah<br>
Cuz it sounds so good<br>
but if you really<br>
Want me move it slow<br>
ah there&rsquo;s things<br>
About me<br>
you just have to know<br>
Sometimes I run<br>
sometimes I hide<br>
Sometimes<br>
I&rsquo;m scared of you<br>
But all I really want<br>
is to hold you tight<br>
Treat you right<br>
be with you<br>
Day and night<br>
(all I really want is<br>
To hold you tight)<br>
treat you right<br>
Be with you<br>
day and night<br>
Baby all I need<br>
is time<br>
Just hang around<br>
and you&rsquo;ll see<br>
There&rsquo;s no where<br>
I&rsquo;d rather be<br>
If you love me<br>
trust in me the way<br>
That I trust in you<br>
ah- yeah-<br>
Sometimes I run<br>
sometimes I hide<br>
Sometimes<br>
I&rsquo;m scared of you<br>
But all I really want<br>
is to hold you tight<br>
Treat you right<br>
be with you<br>
Day and night<br>
sometimes I run<br>
Sometimes I hide<br>
sometimes<br>
I&rsquo;m scared of you<br>
but all I really want<br>
Is to hold you tight<br>
treat you right<br>
Be with you<br>
day and night<br>
All I really want is<br>
to hold you tight<br>
Be with you<br>
day and night<br>
Sometimes I run<br>
sometimes I hide<br>
Sometimes<br>
I&rsquo;m scared of you<br>
But all I really want<br>
is to hold you tight-</p>
