<p>I got my first real<br>
six string<br>
Bought it<br>
at the five<br>
And dime played it<br>
till my fingers bled<br>
it Was<br>
the summer of &lsquo;69<br>
Me and some guys<br>
from school<br>
Had a band and<br>
we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit and<br>
Jody got married<br>
I shoulda known<br>
we&rsquo;d never get far<br>
Oh when I look<br>
back now<br>
That summer seemed<br>
to last forever<br>
And if I had<br>
the choice<br>
Yeah I&rsquo;d always<br>
wanna be there<br>
Those were the best<br>
days of my life-</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t no use<br>
in complainin&rsquo;<br>
When you got<br>
a job to do<br>
Spent my evenin&rsquo;s down<br>
at the drive in<br>
And that&rsquo;s<br>
when I met you yeah<br>
Standin&rsquo; on<br>
your mama&rsquo;s porch<br>
You told me that<br>
you&rsquo;d wait forever<br>
Oh and when you<br>
held my hand<br>
I knew that it was<br>
now or never<br>
Those were the best<br>
days of my life<br>
Oh yeah back in the<br>
summer of &lsquo;69 uh-<br>
Man we were<br>
killin&rsquo; time<br>
We were young<br>
and restless<br>
We needed to unwind<br>
I guess nothin&rsquo;<br>
Can last forever<br>
forever no-</p>
<p>And now the times<br>
are changin&rsquo;<br>
Look at everything<br>
that&rsquo;s come and gone<br>
Sometimes<br>
when I play that<br>
Old six string<br>
think about<br>
Ya wonder<br>
what went wrong<br>
Standin&rsquo; on your<br>
mama&rsquo;s porch<br>
You told me it<br>
would last forever<br>
Oh the way you<br>
held my hand<br>
I knew that it was<br>
now or never<br>
Those were the best<br>
days of my life<br>
Oh yeah back in the<br>
summer of &lsquo;69 uh-<br>
Back in the<br>
summer of &lsquo;69<br>
Oh yeah- back in the<br>
summer of &lsquo;69 uh-</p>
