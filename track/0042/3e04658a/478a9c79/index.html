    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=60828" target="_black">60828</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how it<br>
starts just how it<br>
all<br>
begins<br>
You get your sights<br>
on dreams and man a<br>
thousand<br>
different things<br>
You are on for<br>
yourself you&rsquo;re<br>
chasing<br>
cool desire<br>
You get addicted<br>
fast but man you&rsquo;re<br>
playin&rsquo;<br>
with fire<br>
Then there&rsquo;s a day<br>
that comes to you<br>
When you get all<br>
you want<br>
but there&rsquo;s a space<br>
inside that&rsquo;s still<br>
as empty<br>
as it was<br>
&lsquo;Till an angel comes<br>
your way and man<br>
she&rsquo;s<br>
fallin&rsquo; fast<br>
You know she&rsquo;s so<br>
in need but<br>
she is to<br>
afraid to ask<br>
So you hold on out<br>
your hands and<br>
catch her<br>
best you can<br>
And in givin&rsquo;<br>
love you<br>
feel a<br>
better man<br>
And the gift is<br>
what you get by<br>
givin&rsquo; more than<br>
you receive<br>
And you&rsquo;re learnin&rsquo;<br>
fast that maybe<br>
this is how<br>
you&rsquo;ll be happy<br>
&lsquo;Cause in takin&rsquo;<br>
everything you lost<br>
the air you<br>
need to breath<br>
But in givin&rsquo; it<br>
away you found<br>
the precious thing<br>
you seek</p>
<p>Man it&rsquo;s funny how<br>
she smiles how<br>
grateful<br>
she is now<br>
And that how<br>
touches me<br>
deep in my<br>
heart somehow<br>
Yet the mirror<br>
laughs at me<br>
when I forget<br>
myself<br>
When I complain<br>
about this hand<br>
that I<br>
got dealt<br>
And if I<br>
had know before<br>
how much she would<br>
change my life<br>
I&rsquo;d sure go<br>
back in time<br>
and try to tell<br>
that guy hey man<br>
You can do<br>
better than this<br>
you can answer<br>
your prayers<br>
You can grant<br>
your own wish<br>
Just hold on out<br>
your hands and<br>
give the<br>
most you can<br>
And I swear<br>
to you<br>
you&rsquo;ll feel a<br>
better man<br>
And the gift is what<br>
you get by givin&rsquo;<br>
more than<br>
you receive<br>
And you&rsquo;re learnin&rsquo;<br>
fast that maybe<br>
this is how<br>
you&rsquo;ll be happy<br>
&lsquo;Cause in takin&rsquo;<br>
everything<br>
you lost the air<br>
you need to breath<br>
But in givin&rsquo; it<br>
away you found<br>
the precious thing<br>
you seek<br>
And it&rsquo;s<br>
better by far<br>
to do what<br>
you do now<br>
And leave the<br>
rest to love<br>
Just be strong<br>
in who you are<br>
Once you start<br>
on that road<br>
You&rsquo;re safe<br>
in the knowledge<br>
That anyway you go<br>
Will lead you home<br>
Will lead<br>
you home<br>
And the gift is<br>
what you get by<br>
givin&rsquo; more<br>
than you receive<br>
And you&rsquo;re learnin&rsquo;<br>
fast that maybe<br>
this is how<br>
you&rsquo;ll be happy<br>
&lsquo;Cause in takin&rsquo;<br>
everything<br>
you lost the air<br>
you need to breath<br>
But in givin&rsquo; it<br>
away you found<br>
the precious thing<br>
you seek<br>
So precious<br>
precious precious<br>
precious<br>
oh yeah<br>
So precious<br>
precious precious<br>
precious<br>
oh<br>
So precious<br>
precious precious<br>
precious<br>
oh yeah<br>
So precious<br>
precious precious<br>
precious<br>
oh<br>
And the gift is<br>
what you get by<br>
givin&rsquo; more<br>
than you receive<br>
And you&rsquo;re learnin&rsquo;<br>
fast that maybe<br>
this is how<br>
you&rsquo;ll be happy<br>
&lsquo;Cause in takin&rsquo;<br>
everything<br>
you lost the air<br>
you need to breath<br>
But in givin&rsquo; it<br>
away you found<br>
the precious thing<br>
you seek</p>
