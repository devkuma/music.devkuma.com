    <p>작곡: Sung by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=60168" target="_black">60168</a></p>
<p>Should I? could I?<br>
have said the wrong<br>
Things right<br>
a thousand times<br>
If I could just rewind<br>
I see it in my mind<br>
If I could<br>
turn back time<br>
You&rsquo;d still<br>
be mine<br>
You cried I died<br>
I should have<br>
Shut my mouth<br>
things headed south<br>
As the words slipped<br>
off my tongue<br>
They sounded dumb<br>
if this old<br>
Heart could talk it&rsquo;d<br>
say you&rsquo;re the one<br>
I&rsquo;m wasting time<br>
when I think about it<br>
I should have<br>
drove all night<br>
I would have run<br>
all the lights<br>
I was misunderstood<br>
I stumbled like<br>
My words<br>
did the best<br>
I could<br>
damn misunderstood<br>
Could I? should I?<br>
apologize for<br>
Sleeping on the<br>
couch that night<br>
Staying out too late<br>
with all my friends<br>
You found me passed<br>
out in the yard again<br>
You cried I tried<br>
to stretch the truth<br>
But didn&rsquo;t lie<br>
it&rsquo;s not<br>
So bad when you<br>
think about it<br>
I should have<br>
drove all night<br>
I would have run<br>
all the lights<br>
I was misunderstood<br>
I stumbled like<br>
My words<br>
did the best I could<br>
Damn misunderstood<br>
intentions good</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you and I<br>
just think about it<br>
I should have<br>
drove all night<br>
I would have run<br>
all the lights<br>
I was misunderstood<br>
I stumbled like<br>
My words<br>
did the best I could<br>
I&rsquo;m hanging<br>
outside your door<br>
I&rsquo;ve been here<br>
before misunderstood<br>
I stumbled like<br>
my words<br>
Did the best<br>
I could<br>
Damn misunderstood<br>
intentions good</p>
