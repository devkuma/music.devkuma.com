    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79484" target="_black">79484</a></p>
<p>I was living<br>
my life<br>
Like a long-lost<br>
weekend<br>
Never felt<br>
nothing<br>
Jumping right<br>
into the deep end<br>
I wasn&rsquo;t missing<br>
nothing<br>
That was ever<br>
worth getting<br>
Never hung around<br>
enough to regret it<br>
You came walking<br>
in late<br>
But<br>
just in time<br>
You ended my excuses<br>
with a ten cent rhyme<br>
Your shoes<br>
and attitude were<br>
Stacked way up high<br>
I knew right<br>
Then you were<br>
the story of my life<br>
Oh Saturday night<br>
gave me<br>
Sunday morning<br>
opened my eyes<br>
Now<br>
it&rsquo;s a new day dawning<br>
Think<br>
I might have<br>
Pushed my luck<br>
a time or two<br>
Everything about us is<br>
what gets me through<br>
I never thought<br>
I&rsquo;d hear<br>
The church bells<br>
ringing<br>
I never learned<br>
the song<br>
This heart was singing<br>
no regrets<br>
I took that step<br>
yeah I&rsquo;m still falling<br>
Saturday nights<br>
gave me<br>
Sunday morning<br>
yeah<br>
When you&rsquo;re driving<br>
down a street<br>
That&rsquo;s only going<br>
one way<br>
When every day<br>
starts<br>
Feeling like<br>
a month of Mondays<br>
You should know<br>
I still got<br>
Something<br>
left to prove<br>
I know what it takes<br>
to get back to you<br>
Oh Saturday night<br>
gave me<br>
Sunday morning<br>
opened my eyes<br>
Now<br>
it&rsquo;s a new day dawning<br>
Think<br>
I might have<br>
Pushed my luck<br>
a time or two<br>
Everything about us is<br>
what gets me through<br>
I never thought<br>
I&rsquo;d hear<br>
The church bells<br>
ringing<br>
I never learned<br>
the song<br>
This heart was singing<br>
no regrets<br>
I took that step<br>
yeah I&rsquo;m still falling<br>
Saturday nights<br>
gave me<br>
Sunday morning<br>
yeah<br>
Remember<br>
those nights<br>
Staring out<br>
at the lights<br>
Making<br>
time<br>
With our feet<br>
in the sand<br>
Making up words<br>
to our favorite songs<br>
Laughing loud<br>
with those<br>
Drinks in our hands<br>
and as that boy<br>
Put his head<br>
on her shoulder<br>
She pulled him tight<br>
to get a bit closer<br>
And as the world<br>
just disappeared<br>
You whispered<br>
in my ear<br>
Oh those Saturday<br>
nights gave me<br>
Sunday morning<br>
opened my eyes<br>
Now<br>
it&rsquo;s a new day dawning<br>
Think<br>
I might have<br>
Pushed my luck<br>
a time or two<br>
Everything about us is<br>
what gets me through<br>
I never thought<br>
I&rsquo;d hear<br>
The church bells<br>
ringing<br>
I never learned<br>
the song<br>
This heart was singing<br>
no regrets<br>
I took that step<br>
yeah I&rsquo;m still falling<br>
Saturday nights<br>
gave me<br>
Sunday morning yeah<br>
Sunday morning</p>
