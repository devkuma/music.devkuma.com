    <p>&ldquo;Her penultimate sighs called softy on the kindling winds<br>
Her saintly eyes filling with tears living with truth<br>
and then a golden flash like the onset of heaven<br>
leaving her screams breaking my heart<br>
and in the grip of fire<br>
i knew the Death of love</p>
<p>Where will you be they tense for warfare?<br>
What will you see with your innocence there?<br>
Where will you be my darling?<br>
Where will you be they tense for warfare?</p>
<p>Where will you be when God is glorifying?<br>
There we will be between the dead and dying<br>
Where will you be my darling?<br>
Where will you be when God is glorifying?</p>
<p>Prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain<br>
For lying passive in the shadows whilst the enemy reigns<br>
Devoted to the votive, holy standard above<br>
&lsquo;By command of the king of Heaven&rsquo;<br>
Came the death of love</p>
<p>Where will you be when they&rsquo;re vilifying?<br>
How will they see when the truth is blinding?<br>
Where will you be my darling?<br>
Where will you be when they&rsquo;re vilifying?</p>
<p>Where will you be when the dark is rising?<br>
How will you keep from it&rsquo;s terrorizing?<br>
Where will you be my darling?<br>
Where will you be when the dark is rising?</p>
<p>Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom<br>
On the saintly iron maiden as she fell from her wound</p>
<p>But visions and ambition<br>
Never listened to submission<br>
And she was on a mission from the highest above<br>
To Lord upon the slaughter<br>
Like a sword through hissing water<br>
She arose where archers sought her<br>
For the death of love</p>
<p>The righteous death of love</p>
<p>Gilles adored her drama<br>
Her suit of pure white armour<br>
Blazed against the English in a torrent of light</p>
<p>And as they rallied onto night</p>
<p>A cancer fled his soul<br>
Dissolving&hellip;</p>
<p>Framed amid the thick of fire<br>
Aflame, a Valkyrie<br>
She made him click without desire<br>
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess</p>
<p>And even when they caught her breath<br>
Her words would leave a scar</p>
<p>&lsquo;For only in the grip of darkness<br>
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars&rsquo;</p>
<p>How will you breathe when their wheels are turning?<br>
How will you know if the sky is burning?<br>
Where will you be my darling?<br>
How will you breathe when their wheels are turning?</p>
<p>Where will you be when Babel builds my fire?<br>
Will you not flee and label me pariah?<br>
Where will you be my darling?<br>
Where will you be when they light my pyre?</p>
<p>Aligned with Joan in all<br>
That was enthroned and divine<br>
He swore to score the crimes<br>
Jackdaws poured on this dove<br>
Crimes he knew alone<br>
Derived from minds of the blind<br>
The church unfurled for murder perched<br>
Upon the death of love</p>
<p>Framed amid the thick of fire<br>
Aflame, a Valkyrie<br>
She claimed the skies were lit with spires<br>
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess</p>
<p>And even when she fought for breath<br>
Her words would leave a scar</p>
<p>&lsquo;For only in the grip of darkness<br>
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars&rsquo;</p>
