    <p>작곡: Billy Joel / 작사: Words &amp; Music by<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s nine o&rsquo;clock<br>
on a Saturday<br>
The regular crowd<br>
shuffles in<br>
There&rsquo;s an old man<br>
sitting next to me<br>
Making love<br>
to his tonic and gin</p>
<p>He says son can you<br>
play me a memory<br>
I&rsquo;m not really sure<br>
how it goes<br>
But it&rsquo;s sad<br>
and it&rsquo;s sweet<br>
And I knew it<br>
complete<br>
When I wore<br>
a younger man&rsquo;s<br>
Clothes na&ndash; na&mdash;<br>
na- na&ndash; na-<br>
Sing us a song<br>
you&rsquo;re the piano man<br>
Sing us a song<br>
tonight<br>
Well we&rsquo;re all in<br>
the mood for a melody<br>
And you&rsquo;ve got us<br>
feeling alright-</p>
<p>Now John at the bar<br>
is a friend of mine<br>
He gets me my drinks<br>
for free<br>
And he&rsquo;s quick<br>
with a joke<br>
Or to light up<br>
your smoke<br>
But there&rsquo;s someplace<br>
that he&rsquo;d rather be<br>
He says Bill I believe<br>
this is killing me<br>
As the smile ran away<br>
from his face<br>
Well I&rsquo;m sure that<br>
I could be<br>
A movie star<br>
if I could get out<br>
Of this place na&ndash;<br>
na&mdash; na- na&ndash; na-<br>
Now Paul is<br>
a real estate novelist<br>
Who never had time<br>
for a wife<br>
And he&rsquo;s talking<br>
with Davy<br>
Who&rsquo;s still<br>
in the navy<br>
And probably<br>
will be for life</p>
<p>And the waitress is<br>
practicing politics<br>
As the businessmen<br>
slowly get stoned<br>
Yes they&rsquo;re sharing<br>
a drink<br>
They call<br>
loneliness<br>
But it&rsquo;s better than<br>
drinking alone</p>
<p>Sing us a song<br>
you&rsquo;re the piano man<br>
Sing us a song<br>
tonight<br>
Well we&rsquo;re all in<br>
the mood for a melody<br>
And you&rsquo;ve got us<br>
feeling alright-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good<br>
crowd for a Saturday<br>
And the manager<br>
give me a smile<br>
&lsquo;Cause he knows<br>
that it&rsquo;s me<br>
They&rsquo;ve been coming<br>
to see<br>
To forget about<br>
life for a while<br>
And the piano<br>
it sounds<br>
Like a carnival<br>
and the microphone<br>
Smells like a beer and<br>
they sit at the bar<br>
And put bread<br>
in my jar<br>
And say man what<br>
are you doing here<br>
Oh- na&ndash; na&mdash;<br>
na- na&ndash; na-<br>
Sing us a song<br>
you&rsquo;re the piano man<br>
Sing us a song<br>
tonight<br>
Well we&rsquo;re all in<br>
the mood for a melody<br>
And you&rsquo;ve got us<br>
feeling alright-</p>
