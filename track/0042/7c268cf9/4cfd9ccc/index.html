<p>There was time<br>
when I thought<br>
Life was over and out<br>
when you went away<br>
From me<br>
my dying heart<br>
Made me hard<br>
to breathe<br>
Would sit in my room<br>
because I didn&rsquo;t want<br>
To have to go out<br>
and see you walking by<br>
One look and I&rsquo;d break<br>
right down and cry ah<br>
Now you say that<br>
you made a big mistake<br>
Never meant to<br>
take your love away<br>
But you can save<br>
your tired apologies<br>
Cause it may seem<br>
hard to believe<br>
but ah<br>
I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; just fine<br>
Getting along<br>
very well<br>
Without you<br>
in my life<br>
(I don&rsquo;t need you<br>
in my life)<br>
But I<br>
I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; just fine<br>
Oh time made me<br>
stronger<br>
You&rsquo;re no longer<br>
on my mind uh-<br>
You were my earth<br>
my number one priority<br>
I gave my love<br>
to only you<br>
Anything you&rsquo;d ask<br>
of me I would do<br>
(Woo) but somewhere<br>
down the road<br>
You felt a change<br>
in the weather<br>
And told me that<br>
you had journey on<br>
A kiss in the wind<br>
and your love was gone<br>
Now you say<br>
you never meant<br>
To play your games<br>
girl don&rsquo;t you know<br>
It&rsquo;s far too late<br>
because you let<br>
Our love<br>
just fall apart<br>
You no longer<br>
have my heart-<br>
I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo;<br>
just fine<br>
Getting along<br>
very well<br>
Without you<br>
in my life<br>
(I don&rsquo;t need you<br>
in my life)<br>
Ah-<br>
I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; just fine-<br>
Stronger<br>
no longer mind<br>
I don&rsquo;t need you<br>
anymore-<br>
When you said goodbye<br>
I felt so all alone<br>
There were times<br>
at night<br>
I couldn&rsquo;t sleep<br>
my heart was<br>
Much to weak<br>
to make it on my own<br>
Baby after<br>
all the misery<br>
And pain<br>
you put me through<br>
So unfair<br>
to me girl<br>
You&rsquo;re no longer<br>
my world<br>
And I ain&rsquo;t<br>
missing you at all-<br>
I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; just fine<br>
baby uh-<br>
I don&rsquo;t need you<br>
I don&rsquo;t need you<br>
In my life<br>
say no I just fine<br>
Time made me stronger<br>
you&rsquo;re no longer oh-<br>
See baby<br>
when you walked away<br>
You didn&rsquo;t think<br>
it would end up<br>
This way<br>
but I knew<br>
You&rsquo;d come around<br>
someday<br>
Just as sure as<br>
my name is wanya say-<br>
Time made me<br>
stronger<br>
You&rsquo;re no longer<br>
on my mind<br>
Uh longer on my mind<br>
uh yeah woo<br>
Yeah woo yeah woo<br>
(I don&rsquo;t need you<br>
In my life)<br>
woo yeah woo</p>
