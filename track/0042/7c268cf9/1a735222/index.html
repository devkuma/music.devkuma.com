<p>Girl you know<br>
we belong together<br>
I don&rsquo;t have time<br>
for you to be playing<br>
With my heart<br>
like this<br>
You&rsquo;ll be mine forever<br>
baby you just wait<br>
We belong together<br>
and you know<br>
That I&rsquo;m right<br>
why do you play<br>
With my heart<br>
why do you play<br>
With my mind<br>
said we&rsquo;d be forever<br>
Said it&rsquo;d never die<br>
how could you love me<br>
And leave me and<br>
never say good-bye<br>
When I can&rsquo;t sleep<br>
at night without<br>
Holding you tight girl<br>
each time I try<br>
I just break down<br>
and cry<br>
Pain in my head oh<br>
I&rsquo;d rather be dead<br>
Spinning<br>
around and around<br>
Although we&rsquo;ve come<br>
To the end of the road<br>
Still I can&rsquo;t let go<br>
it&rsquo;s unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
(Come) to the end<br>
of the road<br>
Still I can&rsquo;t let go<br>
it&rsquo;s unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
Girl I know<br>
you really love me<br>
You just don&rsquo;t realize<br>
you&rsquo;ve never been<br>
There before it&rsquo;s<br>
only your first time<br>
Maybe I&rsquo;ll forgive you<br>
maybe you&rsquo;ll try<br>
We should be happy<br>
together forever<br>
You and I<br>
Will you love me again<br>
Like you love me<br>
before this time<br>
I want you to love me<br>
much more this time<br>
Instead<br>
just come to my bed<br>
And baby<br>
just don&rsquo;t let me go<br>
Although we&rsquo;ve come to<br>
the end of the road<br>
Still I can&rsquo;t let go<br>
it&rsquo;s unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
(Come) to the end of<br>
the road<br>
Still I can&rsquo;t let go<br>
it&rsquo;s unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
Girl I&rsquo;m here for you<br>
all those time<br>
As night<br>
when you just hurt me<br>
And just ran out<br>
with that other fella<br>
Baby I knew about it<br>
I just didn&rsquo;t care<br>
You just<br>
don&rsquo;t understand<br>
How much I love<br>
do you<br>
I&rsquo;m here for you<br>
I&rsquo;m not about<br>
To go out on cheat you<br>
just like you did<br>
But baby<br>
that&rsquo;s alright<br>
I love you anyway<br>
and I&rsquo;m still<br>
Going to be here<br>
with you until<br>
My dying day baby<br>
right now I&rsquo;m just in<br>
So much pain<br>
cuz you just won&rsquo;t<br>
Come back to me<br>
will you<br>
Just come back<br>
yes baby<br>
My heart is lonely<br>
my heart hurts baby<br>
Yes I feel pain too<br>
baby please this time<br>
Instead<br>
just come to my bed<br>
And baby<br>
just don&rsquo;t let me go<br>
Although we&rsquo;ve come to<br>
the end of the road<br>
Still I can&rsquo;t let go<br>
it&rsquo;s unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
Come to the end<br>
of the road<br>
Still I can&rsquo;t let go<br>
it&rsquo;s unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
Come to the end<br>
of the road<br>
Still I can&rsquo;t let go<br>
it&rsquo;s unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you<br>
Come to the end<br>
of the road<br>
Still I can&rsquo;t let go<br>
it&rsquo;s unnatural<br>
You belong to me<br>
I belong to you-</p>
