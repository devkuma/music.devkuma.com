    <p>작곡: Sung by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=8462" target="_black">8462</a></p>
<p>See the tree<br>
how big it&rsquo;s grown<br>
But friend it hasn&rsquo;t<br>
been too long<br>
It wasn&rsquo;t big<br>
I laughed at her<br>
And she got mad<br>
the first day<br>
That she planted<br>
it was just a twig<br>
Then the first snow<br>
came and she ran out<br>
To brush the snow away<br>
so it wouldn&rsquo;t die<br>
Came running<br>
in all excited<br>
Slipped and almost<br>
hurt herself<br>
And I laughed<br>
till I cried<br>
She was always young<br>
at heart<br>
Kinda dumb<br>
and kinda smart<br>
And I loved her so<br>
and I surprised her<br>
With a puppy<br>
kept me up<br>
All christmas eve<br>
two years ago<br>
And it would sure<br>
embarrass her<br>
When I came in<br>
from working late<br>
Cause I would know<br>
that she&rsquo;d been<br>
Sitting there<br>
and crying<br>
Over some sad and<br>
silly late late show<br>
And honey I miss you<br>
and I&rsquo;m beinning good<br>
And I&rsquo;d love<br>
to be with you<br>
If only I could<br>
she wrecked the car<br>
And she was sad<br>
and so afraid<br>
That I&rsquo;d be mad<br>
but what the heck<br>
Though I pretended<br>
hard to be<br>
Guess you could say<br>
she saw<br>
Through me<br>
and hugged my neck<br>
I came home<br>
unexpectedly<br>
And caught her crying<br>
needlessly<br>
In the middle of a day<br>
and it was<br>
In the early spring<br>
when flower bloom<br>
And robins sing<br>
she went away<br>
And honey I miss you<br>
and I&rsquo;m beinning good<br>
And I&rsquo;d love<br>
to be with you<br>
If only I could<br>
one day while<br>
I was not at home<br>
while she was there<br>
And all alone<br>
the angels came<br>
Now all I have is<br>
memories of honey<br>
And I wake up night<br>
and call her name<br>
Now my life<br>
an empty stage<br>
Where honey lived<br>
and honey played<br>
And love grew up<br>
and a small cloud<br>
Passed overhead<br>
and cries down<br>
On the flower bed<br>
that honey loved<br>
And see the tree<br>
how big it&rsquo;s grown<br>
But friend it hasn&rsquo;t<br>
been too long<br>
It wasn&rsquo;t big<br>
and I laughed at her<br>
And she got mad<br>
the first day<br>
That she planted<br>
it was just a twig-</p>
