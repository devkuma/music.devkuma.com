<hr>
<p>Cold heart she ain&rsquo;t with it<br>
Hard to love again and I get it(Sheesh)<br>
Time and time she tried to deal with it<br>
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas yeah<br>
I been in my bag for a minute<br>
I got time today I might spend it<br>
I&rsquo;m just tryna say I might heal it<br>
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas yeah<br>
Yeah yeah<br>
Know you heard a lot of broken promises<br>
Like how he&rsquo;s gonna treat you<br>
better then he did the opposite<br>
Come and let me show you<br>
what the difference is<br>
I got it keep your wallet in your purse<br>
&lsquo;cause we ain&rsquo;t splittin&rsquo; shit<br>
Tickets is booked got a Michelin cook<br>
When these bitches give looks<br>
I don&rsquo;t give &rsquo;em no push<br>
Give you love and affection trust and attention<br>
One bad ex really fucked up the next one<br>
Yeah I won&rsquo;t forfeit<br>
But bringin&rsquo; baggage from your past<br>
gonna make this be a short trip<br>
Questioning me daily sayin&rsquo; baby<br>
please don&rsquo;t play me<br>
I say Girl I understand I do but at a certain point<br>
Gotta take the steering wheel back<br>
and reach a turning point<br>
Always tryna argue every other night<br>
Girl who the fuck is he to fuck you up for life?<br>
Cold heart she ain&rsquo;t with it(Yeah)<br>
Hard to love again and I get it(Sheesh)<br>
Time and time she tried to deal with it<br>
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas yeah<br>
I been in my bag for a minute<br>
I got time today I might spend it<br>
I&rsquo;m just tryna say I might heal it<br>
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas yeah<br>
Yeah yeah<br>
&lsquo;Cause I know what you need<br>
But we could take it slow and I&rsquo;ll let you lead<br>
I know you&rsquo;ve heard it all before<br>
but this a new breed<br>
And I&rsquo;ve been respectin&rsquo; you<br>
could check the news feed<br>
I don&rsquo;t got time to waste<br>
But for you I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to spend all the time it take<br>
Your heart the last thing I&rsquo;m tryna break<br>
If I don&rsquo;t come correct gotta find a way<br>
You just gotta set the bar for me it&rsquo;s hard to reach<br>
For a lame type nigga but not for me<br>
I&rsquo;m tryna kill whatever got curiosity<br>
Lil&rsquo; baby it&rsquo;s the way you keep it on lock for me<br>
We may fall off track we may lose contact<br>
But you know we gon&rsquo; get right back<br>
And it be like that we gon&rsquo; be honest<br>
So you know we gon&rsquo; get right back<br>
You know that I got you<br>
Cold heart she ain&rsquo;t with it<br>
Hard to love again and I get it(Sheesh)<br>
Time and time she tried to deal with it<br>
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas yeah<br>
I been in my bag for a minute<br>
I got time today I might spend it<br>
I&rsquo;m just tryna say I might heal it<br>
But fuck boys fuck it up for real niggas yeah<br>
Yeah yeah</p>
