    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=61892" target="_black">61892</a></p>
<p>Hanging out behind the<br>
club on the weekend<br>
Acting stupid<br>
getting drunk<br>
With my best friends<br>
I couldn&rsquo;t wait<br>
For the summer<br>
and the Warped Tour<br>
I remember<br>
it&rsquo;s the first time<br>
That I saw<br>
her there</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s getting<br>
kicked out of school<br>
Because she&rsquo;s failing<br>
I&rsquo;m kind of nervous<br>
&lsquo;Cause I think all<br>
her friends hate me<br>
She&rsquo;s the one<br>
she&rsquo;ll always be there<br>
She took my hand and<br>
that made it I swear<br>
Because I fell in love<br>
with the girl<br>
At the rock show<br>
she said &lsquo;what&rsquo;<br>
And I told her<br>
that I didn&rsquo;t know<br>
She&rsquo;s so cool<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna<br>
Sneak in through<br>
her window<br>
Everything&rsquo;s better<br>
when she&rsquo;s around<br>
I can&rsquo;t wait<br>
&rsquo;til her parents<br>
Go out of town<br>
I fell in love<br>
With the girl<br>
at the rock show</p>
<p>When we said<br>
we were gonna<br>
Move to vegas<br>
I remember<br>
The look her mother<br>
gave us<br>
Seventeen without<br>
a purpose or direction<br>
We don&rsquo;t owe anyone<br>
a fucking explanation<br>
I fell in love<br>
with the girl<br>
At the rock show<br>
she said &lsquo;what&rsquo;<br>
And I told her<br>
that I didn&rsquo;t know<br>
She&rsquo;s so cool<br>
gonna sneak in<br>
Through her window<br>
everything is better<br>
When she&rsquo;s around<br>
I can&rsquo;t wait<br>
&lsquo;Til her parents<br>
go out of town<br>
I fell in love<br>
with the girl<br>
At the rock show<br>
black and white<br>
Picture of her<br>
on my wall<br>
I waited for<br>
her call<br>
She always<br>
kept me waiting<br>
And if I ever<br>
got another chance<br>
I&rsquo;d still ask<br>
her to dance<br>
Because she kept me<br>
waiting<br>
I fell in love<br>
with the girl<br>
At the rock show<br>
she said &lsquo;what&rsquo;<br>
And I told her<br>
that I didn&rsquo;t know<br>
She&rsquo;s so cool<br>
gonna sneak in<br>
Through her window<br>
everything is better<br>
When she&rsquo;s around<br>
I can&rsquo;t wait<br>
&lsquo;Til her parents<br>
go out of town<br>
I fell in love<br>
with the girl<br>
At the rock show<br>
with the girl<br>
At the rock show<br>
with the girl<br>
At the rock<br>
show<br>
I&rsquo;ll never<br>
forget tonight<br>
I&rsquo;ll never<br>
forget tonight<br>
I&rsquo;ll never<br>
forget tonight<br>
I&rsquo;ll never<br>
forget tonight<br>
I&rsquo;ll never<br>
forget tonight<br>
I&rsquo;ll never<br>
forget tonight</p>
