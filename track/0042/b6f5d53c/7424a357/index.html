<p>There&rsquo;s something<br>
about you know her<br>
It&rsquo;s the way that<br>
she carries herself<br>
She&rsquo;s just so bad<br>
oh I don&rsquo;t know<br>
Her style<br>
her mind<br>
Compares ti nothing<br>
on this earth<br>
She&rsquo;s not the kind<br>
to share<br>
Only God knows<br>
what she&rsquo;s worth<br>
I got to show her<br>
that I want her<br>
I recognize that<br>
she is bad<br>
If I can&rsquo;t have her<br>
thes I&rsquo;ll go crazy<br>
Spending all my time<br>
just chasing<br>
I got to show her<br>
that I want her<br>
I recognize that<br>
she is bad<br>
If I can&rsquo;t have her<br>
thes I&rsquo;ll go crazy<br>
Spending all my time<br>
just chasing<br>
Her eyes her smile<br>
her skins her smell<br>
Her hair (she&rsquo;s<br>
incredible baby)<br>
Her walk her talk<br>
her way<br>
Her savoir faire<br>
there she goes<br>
There she goes<br>
there she goes<br>
I hope to find<br>
her there<br>
Gotta make<br>
some eye contact<br>
She&rsquo;s not the kind<br>
of this stare<br>
Move quick or<br>
lose her fast<br>
Woo I got to show her<br>
that I want her<br>
I recognize that<br>
she is bad<br>
If I can&rsquo;t have her<br>
thes I&rsquo;ll go crazy<br>
Spending all my time<br>
just chasing<br>
I got to show her<br>
that I want her<br>
I recognize that<br>
she is bad<br>
If I can&rsquo;t have her<br>
thes I&rsquo;ll go crazy<br>
Spending all my time<br>
