    <p>작곡: Justin Frank&hellip;, B.O.B. / 작사: Words &amp; Music by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=84955" target="_black">84955</a></p>
<p>Can we pretend<br>
that airplanes<br>
In the night sky are<br>
like shooting stars<br>
I could really use<br>
a wish right now<br>
Wish right now<br>
wish right now<br>
Can we pretend<br>
that airplanes<br>
In the night sky are<br>
like shooting stars<br>
I could really use<br>
a wish right now<br>
Wish right now<br>
wish right now<br>
I could use<br>
a dream<br>
Or a genie<br>
or a wish<br>
To go back to a place<br>
much simpler than this<br>
Cause after<br>
all the partyin&rsquo;<br>
And smashin&rsquo;<br>
and crashin&rsquo;<br>
And all<br>
the glitz<br>
And the glam<br>
and the fashion<br>
And all<br>
the pandemonium<br>
And all<br>
the madness<br>
There comes<br>
a time<br>
Where you fade<br>
to the blackness<br>
And when you&rsquo;re<br>
staring<br>
At that phone<br>
in your lap<br>
And you hopin&rsquo;<br>
but them people<br>
Never call<br>
you back<br>
But that&rsquo;s just how<br>
the story unfolds<br>
You get another hand<br>
soon after you fold<br>
And when your plans<br>
unravel<br>
And they sayin&rsquo; what<br>
would you wish for<br>
If you had<br>
one chance<br>
So airplane airplane<br>
sorry I&rsquo;m late<br>
I&rsquo;m on my way so<br>
don&rsquo;t close that gate<br>
If I don&rsquo;t<br>
make that<br>
Then I&rsquo;ll switch<br>
my flight<br>
And I&rsquo;ll be right back<br>
at it<br>
By the end<br>
of the night<br>
Can we pretend<br>
that airplanes<br>
In the night sky are<br>
like shooting stars<br>
I could really use<br>
a wish right now<br>
Wish right now<br>
wish right now<br>
Can we pretend<br>
that airplanes<br>
In the night sky are<br>
like shooting stars<br>
I could really use<br>
a wish right now<br>
Wish right now<br>
wish right now<br>
Somebody take me back<br>
to the days<br>
Before this was a job<br>
before I got paid<br>
Before it ever<br>
mattered<br>
What I had in my bank<br>
yeah back<br>
When I was tryin&rsquo;<br>
to get into the subway<br>
And back<br>
when I was rappin&rsquo;<br>
For the hell<br>
of it<br>
But now a days<br>
we rappin&rsquo;<br>
To stay<br>
relevant<br>
I&rsquo;m guessin&rsquo;<br>
that if we can make<br>
Some wishes<br>
outta airplanes<br>
Then maybe<br>
yo maybe<br>
I&rsquo;ll go back<br>
to the days<br>
Before<br>
the politics<br>
That we call<br>
the rap game<br>
And back<br>
when ain&rsquo;t nobody<br>
Listened<br>
to my mix tape<br>
And back<br>
before<br>
I tried to cover up<br>
my slang<br>
But this is<br>
for the Cada<br>
What&rsquo;s up<br>
Bobby Ray<br>
So can I get a wish<br>
to end the politics<br>
And get back<br>
to the music<br>
That started<br>
this shit<br>
So here I stand<br>
and then again I say<br>
I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo;<br>
we can make<br>
Some wishes<br>
outta airplanes<br>
Can we pretend<br>
that airplanes<br>
In the night sky are<br>
like shooting stars<br>
I could really use<br>
a wish right now<br>
Wish right now<br>
wish right now<br>
Can we pretend<br>
that airplanes<br>
In the night sky are<br>
like shooting stars<br>
I could really use<br>
a wish right now<br>
Wish right now<br>
wish right now<br>
I could really use<br>
a wish right now<br>
I could really use<br>
a wish right now<br>
Like like<br>
like shooting stars<br>
I could really use<br>
a wish right now<br>
A wish<br>
a wish right now</p>
