Play on player<br>
Yo Trey-drop<br>
the verse<br>
It&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; down<br>
fade to Blackstreet<br>
The homies got<br>
collab creations<br>
Bump like<br>
Daphne no doubt<br>
I put it down<br>
never slouch<br>
As long as<br>
my credit can vouch<br>
A dog couldn&rsquo;t<br>
catch me Tell me who<br>
can stop the<br>
Trey makin&rsquo; moves?<br>
Attractin&rsquo;<br>
honeys like a<br>
magnet Givin&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;em ear-gasams with<br>
my mellow waxin&rsquo;<br>
Still movin&rsquo;<br>
this flavor<br>
with the homies<br>
Blackstreet and<br>
Teddy The original<br>
rump-shakers<br>
Gotta get down good<br>
lord Baby<br>
got &rsquo;em hopin&rsquo;<br>
all over town<br>
Strictly biz she<br>
don&rsquo;t play<br>
around Cover<br>
much ground Got<br>
games by the pound<br>
Gettin&rsquo; paid<br>
is her forte<br>
each and<br>
every day True<br>
player win<br>
I can&rsquo;t get her<br>
outta my mind I think<br>
about the girl<br>
all the time<br>
East side to the<br>
west side Pushin&rsquo;<br>
fat rides is<br>
no surprise<br>
She got tricks<br>
in the stash<br>
Stackin&rsquo; up the<br>
cash Fast when it<br>
comes to the gas<br>
By no means average<br>
She&rsquo;s on when<br>
she&rsquo;s got to have it<br>
Baby you&rsquo;re a<br>
perfect 10<br>
I wanna get<br>
in Can I get down<br>

work it (No diggity)<br>
I got to bag it up<br>
I like the way<br>

She&rsquo;s got class<br>
and style She&rsquo;s got<br>
knowledge by<br>
the pound<br>
Baby never acts<br>
wild Very low key<br>
on the profile<br>
Catchin&rsquo; feelings<br>
is unknown<br>
Let me tell<br>
you how it goes<br>
Herb&rsquo;s the word<br>
spin&rsquo;s the verb<br>
Lovers hit curves<br>
so freak what&rsquo;s<br>
you hurry?<br>
Rollin&rsquo; with the<br>
fatness You don&rsquo;t<br>
even know what<br>
the half is<br>
You&rsquo;ve got to pay<br>
to play Just<br>
for shorty<br>
then to look your way<br>
I like the way<br>
