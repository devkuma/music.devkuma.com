    <p>작곡: P.., Kenichiro Nishihara / 작사: Words &amp; Music by<br>

<p>Consider<br>
my love<br>
The days when we were<br>
together so young<br>
Our love was enough<br>
remember<br>
1974<br>
the Lord put me<br>
On this planet<br>
with a plan to be<br>
As hard as granite<br>
calm spirit no panic<br>
At the childbirth<br>
verse read<br>
Mother shaped my head<br>
with a kiss<br>
&ldquo;Xamn he got a strong<br>
grip&rdquo; as I suckled<br>
My father&rsquo;s knees<br>
buckled<br>
From the joy<br>
luck would have it<br>
That this bouncing<br>
baby boy would<br>
Gravitate towards<br>
being<br>
Poetic<br>
emceein&rsquo; in the future<br>
But for now<br>
on the nipple<br>
Like a hookah<br>
fast forward<br>
Play games<br>
and duke a bit<br>
The years progress<br>
messed with cats<br>
That dib<br>
and dabbled in chess<br>
Less strategical<br>
but meaningful<br>
Growing was completed<br>
so fast<br>
3rd grader doing<br>
5th grade math<br>
Knew the library staff<br>
and half the books<br>
I read shed light<br>
xamn<br>
Those Arabian Knights<br>
was influenced by love<br>
That be<br>
of my birthright<br>
Consider<br>
my love<br>
The days when we were<br>
together so young<br>
Our love was enough<br>
remember<br>
Sundays at church<br>
watching the preacher<br>
Work the pulpit<br>
sit<br>
Next<br>
to ma pay attention<br>
Or you&rsquo;d get pent<br>
against the wall<br>
Times was serious<br>
but love conquered<br>
Above sponsors<br>
of hate<br>
So we had to relate<br>
in those days<br>
Hiphop was<br>
ill conforming<br>
To the whack<br>
performing was unreal<br>
And listen<br>
that&rsquo;s real<br>
We&rsquo;d kill for a chance<br>
to go dance &amp; wop<br>
Pop music was<br>
hot &amp; new<br>
Boys would<br>
pop &amp; groove<br>
With high<br>
tops &amp; loose shoes<br>
To hiphop<br>
that<br>
Incorporated<br>
jazz &amp; blues<br>
In high school<br>
arts were plentiful<br>
Magnetic programs<br>
romance was synthetic<br>
Dead it in a minute<br>
so much love<br>
But love<br>
I&rsquo;m tryin to get it<br>
Through roads<br>
and streets<br>
Avenues<br>
and creeks<br>
Seek<br>
what my heart desires<br>
Buying tracks that<br>
meet complete now so<br>
Consider<br>
my love<br>
The days when we were<br>
together so young<br>
Our love was enough<br>
remember<br>
Those family functions<br>
no interruptions<br>
Bustin&rsquo; &ldquo;The Dozens&rdquo;<br>
on kin folk<br>
Mainly your cousins<br>
it&rsquo;s all love<br>
In good spirit<br>
used to hear it<br>
From the older<br>
generation<br>
Chasin&rsquo; them dreams<br>
and stacking cream<br>
For all of us<br>
we used to boost a bit<br>
Young kids<br>
with the itch<br>
To have them cool fits<br>
and fly kicks<br>
Nike Dunks<br>
California raised<br>
So the hustle was<br>
engrained from day one<br>
Fake one&rsquo;s that front<br>
give it up<br>
Childhood was<br>
good<br>
From Stockton<br>
to Inglewood<br>
Boggs Tract<br>
in fact is<br>
Where the foundation<br>
lies at<br>
Now Mac trucks back up<br>
to speed the track up<br>
I plead<br>
don&rsquo;t crack up<br>
The dirt<br>
before we act up<br>
From the foot<br>
to the brain<br>
Impact cuts<br>
the soul deep<br>
A whole heap<br>
but peep we still gain<br>
Things have<br>
changed<br>
But memories<br>
stay the same<br>
This brave heart<br>
parts with<br>
Consider<br>
my love<br>
The days when we were<br>
together so young<br>
Our love was enough<br>
remember<br>
Consider<br>
my love<br>
The days when we were<br>
together so young<br>
Our love was enough<br>
remember<br>
Consider<br>
my love</p>
