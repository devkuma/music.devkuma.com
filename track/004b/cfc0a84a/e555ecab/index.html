<p>Isn&rsquo;t it strange<br>
That you used to know me<br>
All the highs and lows and in betweens<br>
And now you see me and just say hey<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it weird<br>
That you&rsquo;ve seen me naked<br>
We had conversations about forever now<br>
It&rsquo;s about the weather okay<br>
I just can&rsquo;t believe<br>
We went from strangers to lovers<br>
To strangers in a lifetime<br>
Now just memories<br>
We&rsquo;ve gone from strangers<br>
To lovers to strangers<br>
(Yeah)<br>
Acting like we never met<br>
Faking like we&rsquo;d just forget<br>
We were lovers<br>
And now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk<br>
Had every inch of your skin<br>
There&rsquo;s nowhere your hands haven&rsquo;t been<br>
Ain&rsquo;t it funny<br>
&lsquo;Cause now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it wild<br>
That I know your weakness<br>
And everybody at the party thinks<br>
That you&rsquo;re the best since sliced bread<br>
And isn&rsquo;t it awkward<br>
I got a new somebody<br>
And honestly it will probably be a while<br>
Before we can just be friends<br>
I just can&rsquo;t believe<br>
We went from strangers to lovers<br>
To strangers in a lifetime<br>
Now just memories<br>
We&rsquo;ve gone from strangers<br>
To lovers to strangers<br>
(Small talk)<br>
Acting like we never met<br>
Faking like we&rsquo;d just forget<br>
We were lovers<br>
And now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk<br>
Had every inch of your skin<br>
There&rsquo;s nowhere your hands haven&rsquo;t been<br>
Ain&rsquo;t it funny<br>
&lsquo;Cause now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk<br>
And I just can&rsquo;t believe<br>
We went from strangers<br>
To lovers to strangers<br>
Acting like we never met<br>
Faking like we&rsquo;d just forget<br>
We were lovers<br>
And now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk<br>
Had every inch of your skin<br>
There&rsquo;s nowhere your hands haven&rsquo;t been<br>
Ain&rsquo;t it funny<br>
&lsquo;Cause now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Blah blah blah blah<br>
Now there&rsquo;s nothing left but small talk</p>
