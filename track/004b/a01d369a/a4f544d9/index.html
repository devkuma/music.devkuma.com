<p>Take what you want<br>
take everything<br>
Take what you want<br>
take what you want<br>
Better that<br>
I change my number<br>
So you can&rsquo;t<br>
explain<br>
Violence in the night<br>
violence in the night<br>
Priors priors<br>
do you have any priors<br>
Well<br>
that one time<br>
I&rsquo;ll be honest<br>
I&rsquo;ll be honest<br>
We all liars<br>
let it go<br>
I&rsquo;ll be honest<br>
we all liars<br>
I&rsquo;ll be honest<br>
we all liars<br>
I&rsquo;m pulled over<br>
and I got priors<br>
Guess<br>
we goin&rsquo; down<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
God gon&rsquo; post<br>
my bail tonight<br>
Don&rsquo;t you curse at me<br>
on text<br>
Why you try<br>
to hit the flex<br>
I hold up<br>
like what<br>
I scroll I scroll up<br>
like next<br>
Guess<br>
who&rsquo;s getting &rsquo;exed<br>
Like<br>
next<br>
Guess<br>
who&rsquo;s getting &rsquo;exed<br>
You made a choice<br>
that&rsquo;s your bad<br>
Single life ain&rsquo;t<br>
so bad<br>
But we ain&rsquo;t finna<br>
go there<br>
Something&rsquo;s off<br>
I&rsquo;ll tell you why<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
What a grand plan<br>
to sell you out<br>
I could scream<br>
and shout<br>
Let it<br>
out<br>
I&rsquo;ll be honest<br>
we all liars<br>
I&rsquo;ll be honest<br>
we all liars<br>
I&rsquo;m pulled over<br>
and I got priors<br>
Guess<br>
we goin&rsquo; down<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
God gon&rsquo; post<br>
my bail tonight<br>
God in my cells<br>
that&rsquo;s my celly<br>
Made in the image<br>
of God<br>
That&rsquo;s<br>
a selfie<br>
Pray five times a day<br>
so many felonies<br>
Who gon&rsquo; post my bail<br>
Lord help me<br>
Hol&rsquo; up donda<br>
I&rsquo;m with your baby<br>
When I touch back<br>
road<br>
Told him stop<br>
all of that red cap<br>
We goin&rsquo;<br>
home<br>
Not me<br>
with all of these sins<br>
Castin&rsquo;<br>
stones<br>
This might be<br>
the return<br>
Of the throne<br>
throne<br>
Hova and Yeezus<br>
like Moses and Jesus<br>
You are not in control<br>
of my thesis<br>
You already<br>
know<br>
What I think &lsquo;bout<br>
think pieces<br>
Before you ask<br>
he already told you<br>
Who he think he is<br>
don&rsquo;t try to jail<br>
My thoughts<br>
and think precincts<br>
I can&rsquo;t<br>
be controlled<br>
With programs<br>
and presets reset<br>
On my cell<br>
in my cell tonight<br>
Don&rsquo;t have to see you<br>
to touch you<br>
This is<br>
what braille<br>
Look like<br>
it&rsquo;s on sight<br>
If they take me<br>
to jail<br>
Call my girl<br>
tell her send my mail<br>
We know<br>
what hell look like<br>
Still it&rsquo;s a hell<br>
of a life yikes<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
Guess who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;<br>
to jail tonight<br>
God gon&rsquo; post<br>
my bail tonight</p>
