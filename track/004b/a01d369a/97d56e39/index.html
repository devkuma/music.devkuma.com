<p>See this<br>
in 3D<br>
All lights out for me<br>
all lights out for me<br>
Lightning strikes<br>
the beach<br>
Eighty degrees<br>
warm it up for me<br>
Finally free<br>
found the God in me<br>
And I want you to see<br>
I can walk on water<br>
Thousand miles<br>
from shore<br>
I can float<br>
on the water<br>
Father hold me close<br>
don&rsquo;t let me drown<br>
I know<br>
you won&rsquo;t<br>
Yeah<br>
walkin&rsquo; on the bridge<br>
I threw my sins<br>
over the deep end<br>
Sippin&rsquo;<br>
&rsquo;til my stomach hurt<br>
This month I done lost<br>
three friends<br>
Early mornin&rsquo;<br>
brainstormin&rsquo;<br>
Normally<br>
I can&rsquo;t sleep in<br>
Sometimes I just wanna<br>
restart it<br>
But it all<br>
depends<br>
If I&rsquo;ma be that<br>
same young<br>
Hungry<br>
from West End<br>
Wrote<br>
my hardest wrongs<br>
And the crazy part<br>
I ain&rsquo;t have no pen<br>
Maybach interior came<br>
with sheepskin<br>
Still<br>
remember<br>
When I just had<br>
three bands<br>
Now I&rsquo;m the one<br>
everyone call on<br>
&lsquo;Cause<br>
I got deep pants<br>
Bro told me<br>
the way to beat<br>
The game is<br>
on the defense and<br>
Never fazed<br>
by names<br>
That<br>
they might call me<br>
But<br>
they gon&rsquo; respect it<br>
And<br>
I feel like you<br>
Better off<br>
tryin&rsquo; to call<br>
I might not<br>
get the message<br>
And<br>
she just tried<br>
To run off<br>
with my heart<br>
But I blocked off<br>
the exit yeah<br>
Oh I know you won&rsquo;t<br>
I know you won&rsquo;t<br>
I know you won&rsquo;t<br>
I know you won&rsquo;t<br>
I know that<br>
you look over us<br>
So we silently<br>
sleep<br>
Bring down the rain<br>
yeah oh<br>
Mm mm mm mm mm<br>
I was out for self<br>
Mm mm mm mm mm<br>
I was up for sale<br>
But I couldn&rsquo;t tell<br>
God made it rain<br>
The devil made it hail<br>
dropped out of school<br>
But I&rsquo;m that one<br>
at Yale<br>
Made<br>
the best tracks<br>
And still went off<br>
the rail<br>
Had to go<br>
down down down<br>
This the new<br>
town town town<br>
This the new<br>
ten ten ten<br>
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;<br>
in in in<br>
Here I go<br>
on a new trip<br>
Here I go<br>
actin&rsquo; too lit<br>
Here I go<br>
actin&rsquo; too rich<br>
Here I go<br>
with a new chick<br>
And I know<br>
what the truth is<br>
Still playin&rsquo;<br>
after two kids<br>
It&rsquo;s a lot<br>
to digest<br>
When your life<br>
always movin&rsquo;<br>
Architectural<br>
Digest<br>
But I needed<br>
home improvement<br>
Sixty million dollar<br>
home<br>
Never went home to it<br>
genius gone clueless<br>
It&rsquo;s a whole<br>
lot to risk<br>
Alcohol<br>
anonymous<br>
Who&rsquo;s the busiest<br>
loser<br>
Heated by the rumors<br>
read into it too much<br>
Fiendin&rsquo;<br>
for some true love<br>
Ask Kim<br>
what do you love<br>
Hard to find<br>
what the truth is<br>
But the truth was<br>
that the truth suck<br>
Always<br>
seem to do stuff<br>
But this time<br>
it was too much<br>
Mm mm<br>
mm mm mm<br>
Everybody<br>
so judgemental<br>
Everybody<br>
so judgemental<br>
Everybody<br>
hurts<br>
But I don&rsquo;t judge<br>
rentals<br>
Mm mm mm mm mm<br>
it was all so simple<br>
I see you<br>
in 3D<br>
The dawn is<br>
bright for me<br>
No more dark<br>
for me<br>
I know<br>
you&rsquo;re watching me<br>
80 degrees<br>
burning up the leaves<br>
Finally I&rsquo;m free<br>
finally I&rsquo;m free<br>
As I go out to sea<br>
I can walk on water<br>
Won&rsquo;t you shine<br>
your light<br>
Demons stuck<br>
on my shoulder<br>
Father hold me close<br>
don&rsquo;t let me drown<br>
I know<br>
you won&rsquo;t</p>
