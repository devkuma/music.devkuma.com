KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=8717" target="_black">8717</a></p>
<p>Every night she walks<br>
right in my dreams<br>
Since I met her<br>
from the start<br>
I&rsquo;m so proud<br>
I am the only one<br>
Who is special<br>
in her heart<br>
The girl is mine<br>
the doggone girl<br>
Is mine<br>
I know she&rsquo;s mine<br>
Because the doggone<br>
girl is mine<br>
I don&rsquo;t understand<br>
the way you think<br>
Saying that<br>
she&rsquo;s yours not mine<br>
Sending roses<br>
and your silly dreams<br>
Really just<br>
waste of time<br>
Because she&rsquo;s mine<br>
the doggone girl<br>
Is mine<br>
don&rsquo;t waste your time<br>
Because the doggone<br>
girl is mine<br>
I love you<br>
more than he<br>
(Take you anywhere)<br>
but I love you<br>
Endlessly<br>
(loving we will share)<br>
So come and go with me<br>
two on the town<br>
But we both<br>
cannot have her<br>
So it&rsquo;s one<br>
or the other<br>
And one day<br>
you&rsquo;ll discover<br>
That she&rsquo;s my girl<br>
forever and ever<br>
Don&rsquo;t build your hopes<br>
to be let down<br>
Cause I really feel<br>
it&rsquo;s time<br>
I know she&rsquo;ll tell you<br>
I&rsquo;m the one for her<br>
Cause she said<br>
I blow her mind<br>
The girl is mine<br>
the doggone girl<br>
Is mine<br>
don&rsquo;t waste your time<br>
Because the doggone<br>
girl is mine<br>
She&rsquo;s mine she&rsquo;s mine<br>
no no no she&rsquo;s mine<br>
The girl is mine<br>
the girl is mine<br>
The girl is mine<br>
the girl is mine<br>
The girl is mine<br>
(yep) she&rsquo;s mine<br>
The girl is mine<br>
(yes) she&rsquo;s mine<br>
Don&rsquo;t waste your time<br>
because<br>
The doggone girl<br>
is mine<br>
The girl is mine<br>
the girl is mine<br>
Michael we&rsquo;re not<br>
going to fight<br>
About this okay?<br>
Paul I think<br>
I told you I&rsquo;m a lover<br>
not a fighter<br>
I&rsquo;ve heard it all<br>
before Michael<br>
She told me that<br>
I&rsquo;m her for ever lover<br>
You know<br>
don&rsquo;t you remember<br>
Well after loving me<br>
she said<br>
She couldn&rsquo;t love<br>
another<br>
Is that what she said<br>
Yes she said it<br>
You keep dreaming<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe it<br>
The girl is mine<br>
no mine no mine<br>
She&rsquo;s mine mine<br>
mine mine mine<br>
The girl is mine<br>
the girl is mine<br>
The girl is<br>
mine-</p>
