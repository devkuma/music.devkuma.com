    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=61587" target="_black">61587</a></p>
<p>She came from Greece<br>
she had a thirst<br>
for knowledge<br>
She studied<br>
sculpture at<br>
Saint Martins<br>
College That&rsquo;s<br>
where I caught<br>
her eye<br>
She told me that<br>
her dad<br>
was loaded<br>
I said In that<br>
case I&rsquo;ll have<br>
a rum<br>
&amp; coca-cola<br>
She said Fine &amp;<br>
in 30 seconds<br>
time she said<br>
I want to live like<br>
common people I<br>
want to do whatever<br>
common people do<br>
I want to sleep with<br>
common people<br>
I want to sleep with<br>
common people<br>
like you<br>
Well what else<br>
could I do? I said<br>
I&rsquo;ll see what<br>
I can do<br>
I took her to a<br>
supermarket<br>
I don&rsquo;t know why<br>
but I had to<br>
start it<br>
somewhere So it<br>
started there<br>
I said Pretend<br>
you&rsquo;ve got<br>
no money<br>
But she just<br>
laughed &amp; said Oh<br>
you&rsquo;re so funny<br>
I said Yeah?<br>
Well I can&rsquo;t<br>
see anyone<br>
else smiling<br>
in here<br>
Are you sure you<br>
want to live like<br>
common people?<br>
You want to see<br>
whatever common<br>
people see<br>
You want to sleep<br>
with common people<br>
You want to sleep<br>
with common people<br>
like me?<br>
But she didn&rsquo;t<br>
understand<br>
she just<br>
smiled &amp; held<br>
my hand<br>
Rent a flat above a<br>
shop Cut your hair<br>
&amp; get a job<br>
Smoke some fags<br>
&amp; play<br>
some pool<br>
Pretend you never<br>
went to school<br>
But still you&rsquo;ll<br>
never get it right<br>
&lsquo;cos when you&rsquo;re<br>
laid in bed<br>
At night watching<br>
roaches climb<br>
the wall<br>
If you called your<br>
dad he could<br>
stop it all<br>
You&rsquo;ll never live<br>
like common people<br>
You&rsquo;ll never do<br>
whatever common<br>
people do<br>
You&rsquo;ll never fail<br>
like common people<br>
You&rsquo;ll never watch<br>
your life slide<br>
out of view<br>
&amp; dance &amp; drink<br>
&amp; screw Because<br>
there&rsquo;s<br>
nothing else to do</p>
<p>Sing along with the<br>
common people<br>
Sing along &amp; it<br>
might just get yhou<br>
through<br>
Laugh along<br>
with the<br>
common people<br>
Laugh along even<br>
though they&rsquo;re<br>
laughing at you<br>
&amp; the stupid<br>
Things that you do<br>
because you think<br>
that poor is cool<br>
Like a dog lying<br>
in a corner they<br>
will bite you<br>
&amp; never warn you<br>
Look out they&rsquo;ll<br>
tear your<br>
insides out<br>
&lsquo;Cos everybody<br>
hates a tourist<br>
Especially one<br>
who thinks it&rsquo;s<br>
all such a laugh<br>
&amp; the chip<br>
Stains &amp; grease<br>
will come out<br>
in the bath<br>
You will never<br>
understand how it<br>
feels to live your<br>
life with no<br>
Meaning or control<br>
&amp; with nowhere<br>
left to go<br>
You are amazed that<br>
they exist &amp; they<br>
burn so bright<br>
whilst You can only<br>
wonder why<br>
Rent a flat above<br>
a shop Cut your hair<br>
&amp; get a job<br>
Smoke some fags<br>
&amp; play some pool<br>
Pretend you never<br>
went to school<br>
But still you&rsquo;ll<br>
never get it right<br>
&lsquo;cos when you&rsquo;re<br>
laid in bed<br>
At night watching<br>
roaches climb<br>
the wall<br>
If you called your<br>
dad he could<br>
stop it all<br>
You&rsquo;ll never live<br>
like common people<br>
You&rsquo;ll never do<br>
whatever common<br>
people do<br>
You&rsquo;ll never fail<br>
like common people<br>
You&rsquo;ll never watch<br>
your life slide<br>
out of view<br>
&amp; dance &amp; drink<br>
&amp; screw Because<br>
there&rsquo;s<br>
nothing else to do</p>
<p>I wanna<br>
live with<br>
common people<br>
like you<br>
I wanna<br>
live with<br>
common people<br>
like you<br>
I wanna<br>
live with<br>
common people<br>
like you<br>
I wanna<br>
live with<br>
common people<br>
like you<br>
I wanna<br>
