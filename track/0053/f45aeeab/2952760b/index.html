<p>A breathless drive<br>
on a downtown street<br>
Motorbike ride<br>
in the mid-day heat<br>
The dust that hung<br>
from the desert skies<br>
Run<br>
though we run<br>
It still burned<br>
our eyes<br>
Oh yes<br>
we may walk<br>
On the wild wild side<br>
of life<br>
And our movements<br>
traced by a stranger<br>
Close<br>
by your side<br>
And in the shadows<br>
of a promise<br>
You can<br>
take my hand<br>
And show me<br>
way to understand<br>
So if you think you<br>
know how to love me<br>
And you think you know<br>
what I need<br>
And if you really<br>
really want me to stay<br>
You&rsquo;ve got to lead<br>
the way<br>
Yes if you think you<br>
know how to love me<br>
And you think<br>
you can stand by me<br>
And if you really<br>
really want me to stay<br>
You&rsquo;ve got to lead<br>
the way</p>
<p>A reckless night<br>
in a nameless town<br>
Then we moved<br>
out of sight<br>
With a silent<br>
sound<br>
A beach that wept<br>
with deserted waves<br>
That&rsquo;s where we slept<br>
knowing we&rsquo;d be safe<br>
Now you may think<br>
you can walk<br>
On the wild wild side<br>
with me<br>
But there&rsquo;s a lot<br>
I can learn<br>
And a lot<br>
that I&rsquo;ve yet to see<br>
You know<br>
you&rsquo;ve got my life<br>
Lying<br>
in your hands<br>
It&rsquo;s up to you<br>
to make me understand<br>
So if you think you<br>
know how to love me<br>
And you think you know<br>
what I need<br>
And if you really<br>
really want me to stay<br>
You&rsquo;ve got to lead<br>
the way<br>
Yes if you think you<br>
know how to love me<br>
And you think<br>
you can stand by me<br>
And if you really<br>
really want me to stay<br>
You&rsquo;ve got to lead<br>
the way<br>
Yes if you think you<br>
know how to love me<br>
And you think you know<br>
what I need<br>
And if you really<br>
really want me to stay</p>
