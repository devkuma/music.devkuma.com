<p>It is your<br>
new best friend<br>
New eye in your<br>
private den<br>
And you can find<br>
the world inside it<br>
Every day<br>
they know what you<br>
Did today hear<br>
everything you say<br>
And when they<br>
send you mail<br>
They know<br>
where you will go<br>
Sometime next year<br>
they know your life<br>
They have file<br>
about you<br>
They built your life<br>
so they<br>
Know what you<br>
like and<br>
Know what you yearn<br>
but they don&rsquo;t know a<br>
Thing about me<br>
I&rsquo;m not that easy<br>
I&rsquo;m blank file<br>
in their memory<br>
Caught in the<br>
web again<br>
Inside your<br>
private den<br>
Where you can<br>
go to moon<br>
Or meet some people<br>
you will never see<br>
You are a<br>
file in there<br>
Money in<br>
an open fair<br>
You&rsquo;re a slave<br>
among the slaves<br>
Waiting for Y2K<br>
with a fear<br>
They know your life<br>
they have file<br>
About you<br>
they built your life<br>
So they<br>
know what you like and<br>
Know what you yearn<br>
but they don&rsquo;t know a<br>
Thing about me<br>
I&rsquo;m not that easy<br>
I&rsquo;m blank file<br>
in their memory<br>
Still they<br>
try to take over<br>
Control my life<br>
but no one can do it<br>
But me<br>
I&rsquo;m not that easy<br>
I&rsquo;m blank file<br>
in their memory</p>
<p>Know what you like and<br>
know what you yearn<br>
But they don&rsquo;t know a<br>
thing about me<br>
I&rsquo;m not that easy<br>
I&rsquo;m blank file<br>
In their memory<br>
I am waiting<br>
Hoping and praying<br>
to see how this<br>
Will end<br>
when they go down<br>
How can it be<br>
that you cannot see<br>
What they are<br>
doing with thee<br>
You are a life<br>
new file<br>
In their memory<br>
now they<br>
Know what you like and<br>
know what you yearn<br>
But they don&rsquo;t know a<br>
thing about me<br>
I&rsquo;m not that easy<br>
I&rsquo;m blank file<br>
In their<br>
memory</p>
<p>How can it be<br>
that you cannot see<br>
what they are<br>
doing with thee<br>
Spending you time<br>
living your life<br>
Inside their machines<br>
there is<br>
One empty file<br>
it is me</p>
