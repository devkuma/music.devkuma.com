    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79006" target="_black">79006</a></p>
<p>Love is hard to<br>
find and<br>
It&rsquo;s harder still to<br>
keep alive and<br>
Sometimes<br>
it seems the world<br>
Is filled with<br>
tears and danger<br>
All the stress and<br>
strain of<br>
Everyday the pressure<br>
pain of<br>
People weigh<br>
you down<br>
And it isn&rsquo;t<br>
only strangers<br>
It&rsquo;s you and me<br>
too<br>
We start a<br>
fight<br>
And we don&rsquo;t know<br>
always kiss<br>
We kiss<br>
good night<br>
It starts to<br>
feel like it<br>
Never works<br>
never will<br>
But we rise<br>
above it<br>
We will not<br>
fall<br>
&lsquo;Cuz we&rsquo;re standing on<br>
solid ground<br>
Nobody&rsquo;s gonna<br>
shoot us down<br>
Our love is<br>
bullet proof<br>
Bullet proof<br>
bullet proof<br>
And though<br>
we&rsquo;re only made of<br>
Flesh and<br>
blood<br>
Nothing&rsquo;s hurting us<br>
no matter what<br>
Our love is<br>
bullet proof<br>
Bullet proof<br>
bullet proof<br>
You&rsquo;re my<br>
suit of armour<br>
It feels like<br>
I am so much stronger<br>
Whenever<br>
you&rsquo;re around<br>
It&rsquo;s really good to<br>
know that<br>
There are always those<br>
who wanna see us<br>
Break apart you<br>
know they never will<br>
&lsquo;Cuz we&rsquo;re never gonna<br>
go there<br>
Even though<br>
sometimes<br>
We start a<br>
fight<br>
And we don&rsquo;t know<br>
always kiss<br>
We kiss<br>
good night<br>
It starts to<br>
feel like it<br>
Never works<br>
never will<br>
But we rise<br>
above it<br>
We will not<br>
fall<br>
&lsquo;Cuz we&rsquo;re stading on<br>
solid ground<br>
Nobody&rsquo;s gonna<br>
shoot us down<br>
Our love is<br>
bullet proof<br>
Bullet proof<br>
bullet proof<br>
And though<br>
we&rsquo;re only made of<br>
Flesh and<br>
blood<br>
Nothing&rsquo;s hurting us<br>
no matter what<br>
Our love is<br>
bullet proof<br>
Bullet proof<br>
bullet proof<br>
And everyday&rsquo;s<br>
a test<br>
We&rsquo;re not always<br>
our best<br>
I&rsquo;m not going anywhere<br>
I won&rsquo;t love you less<br>
And I will<br>
never stop<br>
You&rsquo;re getting<br>
all I got baby<br>
We will not<br>
fall<br>
&lsquo;Cuz we&rsquo;re stading on<br>
solid ground<br>
Nobody&rsquo;s gonna<br>
shoot us down<br>
Our love is<br>
bullet proof<br>
Bullet proof<br>
woo yeah<br>
&lsquo;Cuz we&rsquo;re stading on<br>
solid ground<br>
Nobody&rsquo;s gonna<br>
shoot us down<br>
Our love is<br>
bullet proof<br>
Bullet proof<br>
bullet proof<br>
And though<br>
we&rsquo;re only made of<br>
Flesh and<br>
blood<br>
Nothing&rsquo;s hurting us<br>
no matter what<br>
Our love is<br>
bullet proof<br>
Bullet proof<br>
bullet proof<br>
We will not<br>
fall<br>
&lsquo;Cuz we&rsquo;re stading on<br>
solid ground<br>
Nobody&rsquo;s gonna<br>
shoot us down<br>
Our love is<br>
bullet proof<br>
Bullet proof<br>
bullet proof<br>
And though<br>
we&rsquo;re only made of<br>
