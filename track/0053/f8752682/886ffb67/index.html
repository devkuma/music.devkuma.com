<p>Oh Oh<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing you<br>
Been through just<br>
about everything that<br>
I could go through<br>
When it comes to<br>
Relationships<br>
Don&rsquo;t know what<br>
I was missing or why<br>
I ain&rsquo;t listen<br>
When I told myself<br>
that was it<br>
Now here<br>
I go hurt again<br>
Cause of my curiosity<br>
Now that it&rsquo;s over<br>
What else could it be<br>
he just had to cheat<br>
I made a promise<br>
never to settle<br>
Why didn&rsquo;t<br>
I keep it?<br>
Cause I hated<br>
the heartbreak<br>
Crying and cheating<br>
the fooling around<br>
(But) I&rsquo;m not<br>
missing you<br>
I&rsquo;m not going<br>
through the motions<br>
Waiting and<br>
hoping you call me<br>
I&rsquo;m not<br>
missing you<br>
You might<br>
have had me open<br>
But I must be<br>
going because<br>
I got life to do<br>
I know I&rsquo;m usually<br>
Hanging on<br>
I used to hate to<br>
See you gone<br>
But this time<br>
It&rsquo;s different<br>
I don&rsquo;t even<br>
Feel the distance<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing<br>
I&rsquo;m not<br>
missing you<br>
It&rsquo;s a shame<br>
in a way cause<br>
I feel that<br>
I may not ever<br>
Find the right<br>
one for me<br>
Did I leave him is<br>
he right in front of<br>
My face oh<br>
Will my true<br>
Love ever be?<br>
Why would<br>
I go on a<br>
search again<br>
When I know<br>
what the end will be<br>
What good is love<br>
when it keeps<br>
On hurting me?<br>
I made a promise<br>
Never to settle<br>
Why didn&rsquo;t I keep it?<br>
Cause I hated<br>
the heartbreak<br>
Crying and cheating<br>
the fooling around<br>
(But) I&rsquo;m not<br>
missing you<br>
I&rsquo;m not going<br>
through the motions<br>
Waiting and<br>
hoping you call me<br>
I&rsquo;m not<br>
missing you<br>
You might<br>
have had me open<br>
But I must be<br>
going because<br>
I got life to do<br>
I know I&rsquo;m usually<br>
Hanging on<br>
I used to hate to<br>
See you gone<br>
But this time<br>
It&rsquo;s different<br>
I don&rsquo;t even<br>
Feel the distance<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing<br>
I&rsquo;m not<br>
missing you<br>
I&rsquo;m not going<br>
through the motions<br>
Waiting and<br>
hoping you call me<br>
I&rsquo;m not<br>
missing you<br>
You might<br>
have had me open<br>
But I must be<br>
going because<br>
I got<br>
life to do<br>
I know I&rsquo;m<br>
usually hanging on<br>
I used to hate<br>
to see you gone<br>
But this time<br>
it&rsquo;s different<br>
I don&rsquo;t even<br>
feel the distance<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing you<br>
No I can&rsquo;t<br>
be with you<br>
Cause I&rsquo;m scared<br>
felt like<br>
I was falling<br>
when you left me<br>
I can&rsquo;t keep<br>
going through life<br>
Unaware of<br>
what I missed<br>
And the person<br>
I could be<br>
Love&rsquo;s good<br>
when it&rsquo;s right<br>
And when it&rsquo;s<br>
left in your memory<br>
All the times<br>
I let you down<br>
I guess love<br>
will be nice for<br>
Someone<br>
else&rsquo;s life<br>
(But) I&rsquo;m<br>
not missing you<br>
I&rsquo;m not going<br>
through the motions<br>
Waiting and<br>
hoping you call me<br>
I&rsquo;m not<br>
missing you<br>
You might<br>
have had me open<br>
But I must be<br>
going because<br>
I got<br>
life to do<br>
I know I&rsquo;m<br>
usually hanging on<br>
I used to hate<br>
to see you gone<br>
(I used to<br>
hate it)<br>
Different oh<br>
feel the distance<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing you<br>
I&rsquo;m not going<br>
through the motions<br>
Waiting and<br>
hoping you call me<br>
(Knockin&rsquo;<br>
at my door)<br>
You might<br>
have had me open<br>
But I must be<br>
going because<br>
(It&rsquo;s the best<br>
day of my life)<br>
I know I&rsquo;m<br>
usually hanging on<br>
I used to hate<br>
to see you gone<br>
Different<br>
feel the distance<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing you<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing you<br>
(oh baby)<br>
I&rsquo;m not missing you<br>
I&rsquo;m so over you<br>
It ain&rsquo;t<br>
even a problem</p>
