<p>Woke up to the sound<br>
of pouring rain<br>
The wind would whisper<br>
and I&rsquo;d think of you<br>
And all the tears<br>
you cried<br>
That called my name<br>
And when you needed me<br>
I came through<br>
I paint a picture<br>
Of the days gone by<br>
when love went blind<br>
And you would<br>
make me see<br>
I&rsquo;d stare a lifetime<br>
into your eyes<br>
So that I knew that<br>
you were there for me<br>
Time after time<br>
you were there for me<br>
Remember yesterday<br>
walking hand in hand<br>
Love letters<br>
in the sand<br>
I remember you through<br>
the sleepless nights<br>
And every endless day<br>
I&rsquo;d wanna hear<br>
You say I remember you<br>
oh oh oh-<br>
We spent the summer<br>
with the top<br>
Rolled down<br>
wished ever after<br>
Would be like this<br>
you said<br>
I love you babe<br>
without a sound<br>
I said<br>
I&rsquo;d give my life<br>
For just one kiss<br>
I&rsquo;d live<br>
For your smile<br>
and die for your kiss<br>
Remember yesterday<br>
walking hand in hand<br>
Love letters<br>
in the sand<br>
I remember you through<br>
the sleepless nights<br>
And every endless day<br>
I&rsquo;d wanna hear<br>
You say I remember you<br>
we&rsquo;ve had our share<br>
Of hard times<br>
but that&rsquo;s the price<br>
We paid<br>
and through it all<br>
We kept the promise<br>
that we made<br>
I swear you&rsquo;ll never<br>
be lonely-</p>
<p>Ah- woke up<br>
to the sound of<br>
Pouring rain<br>
washed away<br>
A dream of you<br>
but nothing else<br>
Could ever<br>
take you away<br>
&lsquo;Cause you&rsquo;ll always<br>
be my dream come true<br>
Oh my darling<br>
I love you<br>
Remember yesterday<br>
walking hand in hand<br>
Love letters<br>
in the sand<br>
I remember you through<br>
the sleepless nights<br>
And every endless day<br>
I&rsquo;d wanna hear<br>
You say I remember you<br>
remember yesterday<br>
Walking hand in hand<br>
love letters<br>
In the sand<br>
I remember you through<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
and every endless day<br>
I&rsquo;d wanna hear<br>
you say I remember<br>
I remember you&ndash;<br>
oh yeah-</p>
