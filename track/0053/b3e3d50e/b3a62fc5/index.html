We go in<br>
when we go out<br>
I just got<br>

Show up show out<br>

Go in go out<br>
Ciroc we pull out<br>
I got more diamonds<br>
ladies be the finest<br>
Crush grapes<br>
we don&rsquo;t do the wine<br>
Crush denim<br>
top spinning<br>
Cook me<br>
front grillin&rsquo;<br>
Got paid<br>
hop the G5 faded<br>
Rope chain shell toes<br>
wavey like a sailboat<br>
When you hear the haan<br>
there it go<br>
Montana<br>
with the funky sound<br>
Sigala got<br>
the London sound<br>
I should grow up<br>
they say<br>
Stuck<br>
in my glory days<br>
I know<br>
there&rsquo;s nothing wrong<br>
It&rsquo;s just a passing<br>
phase<br>
And<br>
when I&rsquo;ve had my fun<br>
I swear<br>
I&rsquo;ll be someone<br>
I know that day will<br>
come but<br>
I just got<br>
paid<br>
I&rsquo;m broke<br>
but I&rsquo;m ballin&rsquo;<br>
Don&rsquo;t know<br>
where we going<br>
We go in<br>
when we go out<br>
I just got<br>

I&rsquo;m broke<br>
but I&rsquo;m ballin&rsquo;<br>
