<hr>
<p>All the nights I was drownin&rsquo; in the rain<br>
Hold my breath<br>
Tell myself I would see you again<br>
Let the storm blow over for better days<br>
Lookin&rsquo; back never knew what I left behind<br>
Find it hard the view changes all the time<br>
I was always yours and you were always mine<br>
&lsquo;Cause I needed space my heart to break<br>
&lsquo;Cause givin&rsquo; you up was my greatest mistake<br>
I hate I had to lose your love<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it<br>
I hate I couldn&rsquo;t hold you up<br>
When we were in the waters drownin&rsquo;<br>
Now I painted over old mistakes<br>
Just tryin&rsquo; to find my way back to you<br>
I hate I had to lose your love<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it<br>
I see your face in the moments I feel lost<br>
&lsquo;Cause I lost my way and I feel the fault<br>
All I wanna say is I&rsquo;m sorry(Woah)<br>
I just needed space my heart to break<br>
&lsquo;Cause givin&rsquo; you up was my greatest mistake<br>
I hate I had to lose your love<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it<br>
I hate I couldn&rsquo;t hold you up<br>
When we were in the waters drownin&rsquo;<br>
Now I painted over old mistakes<br>
Just tryin&rsquo; to find my way back to you<br>
I hate I had to lose your love<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it<br>
(Woah)<br>
It&rsquo;s like the world stands still<br>
Without your love(Woah)<br>
Nothing&rsquo;s real<br>
I hate I had to lose your love<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it<br>
Hate I couldn&rsquo;t hold you up<br>
When we were in the waters drownin&rsquo;<br>
Now I painted over old mistakes<br>
Just tryin&rsquo; to find my way back to you<br>
I hate I had to lose your love<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it<br>
I hate I had to lose your love<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it<br>
(Woah)<br>
It&rsquo;s like the world stands still<br>
I hate I had to lose your love<br>
To know I couldn&rsquo;t live without it</p>
