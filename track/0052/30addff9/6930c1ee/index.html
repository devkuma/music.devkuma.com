<p>I see you<br>
comb your hair<br>
And gimme that grin<br>
it&rsquo;s making me<br>
Spin now<br>
spinnin&rsquo; within&rsquo;<br>
Before<br>
I melt like snow<br>
I say hello<br>
how do you do<br>
I love the way<br>
you undress now<br>
Baby begin<br>
do your caress honey<br>
My heart&rsquo;s in a mess<br>
I love your blue eyed<br>
Voice like tiny Tim<br>
shines thru<br>
How do you do<br>
(how do you do)<br>
Well here we are<br>
crackin&rsquo; jokes<br>
In the corner of<br>
our mouths<br>
And I feel like I&rsquo;m<br>
laughing in a dream<br>
If I was young<br>
I could wait<br>
Outside your school<br>
cos your face is<br>
Like the cover<br>
of a magazine<br>
How do you do<br>
(do you do)<br>
The things that you do<br>
no one I know<br>
Could ever keep up<br>
with you<br>
How do you do<br>
did it ever make<br>
Sense to you to say<br>
bye bye bye<br>
I see you<br>
in that chair<br>
With perfect<br>
skin well<br>
How have you been baby<br>
livin&rsquo; in sin<br>
Hey I gotta know<br>
did you say hello<br>
How do you do<br>
(how do you do)</p>
<p>Well here we are<br>
spending time<br>
In the louder<br>
part of town<br>
And it feels like<br>
everything&rsquo;s surreal<br>
When I get old<br>
I will wait<br>
Outside your house<br>
cos your hands<br>
Have got the power<br>
meant to heal<br>
How do you do<br>
(do you do)<br>
The things that you do<br>
no one I know<br>
Could ever keep up<br>
with you<br>
How do you do<br>
did it ever make<br>
Sense to you to say<br>
bye bye bye<br>
(Well here we are<br>
crackin&rsquo; jokes)<br>
How do you do<br>
(well here we are<br>
Spending time)<br>
woo<br>
How do you do<br>
(do you do)<br>
The things that you do<br>
no one I know<br>
Could ever keep up<br>
with you<br>
How do you do<br>
did it ever make<br>
Sense to you to cry<br>
bye bye bye<br>
Oh how do you do<br>
(do you do)<br>
The things that you do<br>
no one I know<br>
Could ever keep up<br>
with you<br>
How do you do<br>
did it ever make<br>
Sense to you to say<br>
bye bye bye<br>
Yeah how do you do<br>
(do you do)<br>
The things that you do<br>
no one I know<br>
Could ever keep up<br>
with you-</p>
