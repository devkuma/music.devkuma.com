<p>Huh yeah<br>

Think ya know what<br>
it&rsquo;s all about huh<br>
Hey yo so check this<br>
out yeah-<br>
Know your enemy-<br>
come on-</p>
<p>Born with insight<br>
and a raised fist<br>
A witness to the slit<br>
wrist that&rsquo;s with<br>
As we move into &lsquo;92<br>
still in a room<br>
Without a view<br>
ya got to know<br>
Ya got to know that<br>
when I say go go go<br>
Amp up and<br>
amplify defy<br>
I&rsquo;m a brother<br>
with a furious mind<br>
Action must be taken<br>
we don&rsquo;t need the key<br>
We&rsquo;ll break in<br>
Something must be done<br>
About vengeance<br>
a badge and a gun<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;ll rip<br>
the mike<br>
Rip the stage<br>
rip the system<br>
I was born to rage<br>
against &rsquo;em<br>
First in ya face<br>
in the place<br>
And I&rsquo;ll drop<br>
the style clearly<br>
Know your enemy-<br>
Know your enemy- yeah-<br>
Hey yo and dick<br>
with this<br>
Uggh word is born<br>

Fuck the norm<br>
now I got no patience<br>
So sick of complacence<br>
with the D the E<br>
The F the I the A<br>
the N the C the E<br>
Mind of<br>
a revolutionary<br>
So clear the lane<br>
the finger<br>
To the land of chains<br>
what<br>
The land of the free<br>
whoever told you that<br>
Is your enemy<br>
now something<br>
Must be done<br>
about vengeance<br>
A badge and a gun<br>
&lsquo;cause<br>
I&rsquo;ll rip the mike<br>
rip the stage<br>
Rip the system<br>
I was born to rage<br>
Against &rsquo;em now<br>
action must be taken<br>
We don&rsquo;t need the key<br>
we&rsquo;ll break in<br>
I&rsquo;ve got no<br>
patience now<br>
So sick of<br>
complacence now<br>
I&rsquo;ve got no<br>
patience now<br>
So sick of<br>
complacence now<br>
Sick of sick of<br>
sick of sick of you<br>
Time has come to pay-<br>
know your enemy-</p>
<p>Come on<br>

They&rsquo;re the teachers<br>
who taught me<br>
To fight me<br>
compromise conformity<br>
Assimilation<br>
submission ignorance<br>
Hypocrisy brutality<br>
the elite<br>
All of which are<br>
American dreams<br>
All of which are<br>
American dreams<br>
All of which are<br>
American dreams<br>
All of which are<br>
American dreams<br>
All of which are<br>
American dreams<br>
All of which are<br>
American dreams<br>
All of which are<br>
American dreams<br>
All of which are<br>
American dreams-</p>
