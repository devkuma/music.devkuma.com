    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=60875" target="_black">60875</a></p>
<p>Baby it<br>
don&rsquo;t matter<br>
Anyone can<br>
see the signs<br>
I caught you<br>
looking over<br>
With just a little<br>
bit of a smile<br>
You tell him that<br>
you love him<br>
While I&rsquo;m running<br>
through your mind<br>
&lsquo;Cos I know<br>
that you know<br>
Your cover<br>
will blow<br>
It&rsquo;s only a<br>
matter of time<br>
It&rsquo;s not<br>
my style<br>
To try and<br>
cheat and lie<br>
Why do<br>
you sanctify<br>
Something that<br>
already died<br>
I&rsquo;ve got<br>
something<br>
That&rsquo;ll bring<br>
you alive<br>
Are you gonna<br>
shout it<br>
From the<br>
rooftops honey<br>
Tell me I&rsquo;m<br>
the only one<br>
Kick him to the<br>
kerb and baby<br>
Don&rsquo;t stop<br>
running<br>
Tell me are you gonna<br>
come get some<br>
Did you ever ask<br>
yourself the question<br>
Where the hell<br>
did I go wrong<br>
&lsquo;Cos you know<br>
when it&rsquo;s through<br>
I&rsquo;ll be<br>
waiting for you<br>
So tell me how<br>
you&rsquo;re gonna<br>
Come come<br>
come get some<br>
All those words<br>
you&rsquo;re wasting<br>
Trying to<br>
tell yourself<br>
You need<br>
more time<br>
What&rsquo;s the<br>
point in fakin&rsquo;<br>
When you know<br>
you&rsquo;ll never<br>
Make it<br>
right<br>
You say your head<br>
is blurry<br>
But I can&rsquo;t get<br>
you out of mine<br>
I don&rsquo;t mean to<br>
cause pressure<br>
But I just can&rsquo;t<br>
let you go on<br>
While you&rsquo;re<br>
living this lie<br>
It&rsquo;s not my style<br>
to let this pass me by<br>
Why do you<br>
sanctify<br>
Something that<br>
already died<br>
I&rsquo;ve got<br>
something<br>
That&rsquo;ll bring<br>
you alive<br>
Are you gonna<br>
shout it<br>
From the<br>
rooftops honey<br>
Tell me I&rsquo;m<br>
the only one<br>
Kick him to the<br>
kerb and baby<br>
Don&rsquo;t stop<br>
running<br>
Tell me are you gonna<br>
come get some<br>
Did you ever ask<br>
yourself the question<br>
Where the hell<br>
did I go wrong<br>
&lsquo;Cos you know<br>
when it&rsquo;s through<br>
I&rsquo;ll be<br>
waiting for you<br>
So tell me how<br>
you&rsquo;re gonna<br>
Come come<br>
come get some<br>
Crushed out<br>
and waiting<br>
Blacked out<br>
and fading&rsquo;<br>
Flaked out and shaken&rsquo;<br>
just breaking for you<br>
Breaking<br>
for you<br>
Freaked out<br>
and pacing<br>
I can&rsquo;t go on<br>
like this forever<br>
Are you gonna<br>
shout it<br>
From the<br>
rooftops honey<br>
Tell me I&rsquo;m<br>
the only one<br>
Kick him to the<br>
kerb and baby<br>
Don&rsquo;t stop<br>
running<br>
Tell me are you gonna<br>
come get some<br>
Did you ever ask<br>
yourself the question<br>
Where the hell<br>
did I go wrong<br>
&lsquo;Cos you know<br>
when it&rsquo;s through<br>
I&rsquo;ll be<br>
waiting for you<br>
So tell me how<br>
you&rsquo;re gonna<br>
Come come<br>
come get some</p>
