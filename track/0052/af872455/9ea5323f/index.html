<p>Ah ha ah ha<br>
(yeah Rihanna)<br>
Ah ha ah ha<br>
(good girl gone bad)<br>
Ah ha ah ha<br>
(take three action ho)<br>
No clouds<br>
in my storms<br>
Let it rain<br>
I hydroplane into fame<br>
Come&rsquo;n down<br>
with the Dow Jones<br>
When the clouds<br>
come we gone<br>
We Rocafella<br>
we fly high to weather<br>
And she rocks it<br>
better<br>
You know me<br>
an anticipation<br>
For precipitation<br>
stacks chips<br>
For the rainy day<br>
Jay Rain Man is back<br>
With lil Ms. Sunshine<br>
Rihanna where you at?<br>
You had my heart<br>
and we&rsquo;ll never be<br>
World apart<br>
maybe in magazines<br>
But you&rsquo;ll still<br>
be my star<br>
Baby cause in the dark<br>
you can see shiny cars<br>
And that&rsquo;s when you<br>
need me there<br>
With you I&rsquo;ll<br>
always share<br>
Because<br>
when the sun shines<br>
We&rsquo;ll shine<br>
together<br>
Told you<br>
I&rsquo;ll be here<br>
Forever<br>
that I&rsquo;ll always be<br>
Your friend<br>
took an oath Imma<br>
Stick it out<br>
&rsquo;till the end<br>
Now that it&rsquo;s raining<br>
more than ever<br>
Know that we still<br>
have each other<br>
You can stand<br>
under my umbrella<br>
You can stand<br>
under my umbrella<br>
Ella ella eh eh eh<br>
under my umbrella<br>
Ella ella eh eh eh<br>
under my umbrella<br>
Ella ella eh eh eh<br>
under my umbrella<br>
Ella ella eh eh eh<br>
eh eh eh<br>
These fancy<br>
things<br>
Will never come<br>
in between<br>
You&rsquo;re part<br>
of my entity<br>
Here for infinity<br>
when the war has<br>
Took it&rsquo;s part<br>
when the world has<br>
Dealt it&rsquo;s cards<br>
if the hand is hard<br>
Together we&rsquo;ll<br>
mend your heart<br>
Because<br>
when the sun shines<br>
We&rsquo;ll shine<br>
together<br>
Told you<br>
I&rsquo;ll be here<br>
Forever<br>
that I&rsquo;ll always be<br>
Your friend<br>
took an oath Imma<br>
Stick it out<br>
&rsquo;till the end<br>
Now that it&rsquo;s raining<br>
more than ever<br>
Know that we still<br>
have each other<br>
You can stand<br>
under my umbrella<br>
You can stand<br>
under my umbrella<br>
Ella ella eh eh eh<br>
under my umbrella<br>
Ella ella eh eh eh<br>
under my umbrella<br>
Ella ella eh eh eh<br>
under my umbrella<br>
Ella ella eh eh eh<br>

You can run<br>
into my arms<br>
It&rsquo;s OK<br>
don&rsquo;t be alarmed<br>
Come into me<br>
there&rsquo;s no distance<br>
In between<br>
our love<br>
So gonna<br>
let the rain pour<br>
I&rsquo;ll be all you<br>
need and more~<br>
Because<br>
when the sun shines<br>
We&rsquo;ll shine<br>
together<br>
Told you<br>
I&rsquo;ll be here<br>
Forever<br>
that I&rsquo;ll always be<br>
Your friend<br>
took an oath Imma<br>
Stick it out<br>
&rsquo;till the end<br>
Now that it&rsquo;s raining<br>
more than ever<br>
Know that we still<br>
have each other<br>
You can stand<br>
under my umbrella<br>
You can stand<br>
under my umbrella<br>
Ella ella eh eh eh<br>
