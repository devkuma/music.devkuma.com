    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=61256" target="_black">61256</a></p>
<p>Spring was never<br>
waiting for us girl<br>
It ran one step ahead<br>
as we followed<br>
In the dance<br>
between the<br>
Parted pages<br>
and were pressed<br>
In love&rsquo;s hot<br>
fevered iron<br>
Like a striped<br>
pair of pants<br>
MacArthur&rsquo;s Park is<br>
melting in the dark<br>
All the sweet green<br>
icing flowing down<br>
Someone left the<br>
cake out in the rain<br>
I don&rsquo;t think<br>
that I can take it<br>
&lsquo;Cause it took<br>
so long to bake it<br>
And<br>
I&rsquo;ll never have<br>
That recipe again<br>
oh no<br>
I recall the yellow<br>
cotton dress<br>
Foaming<br>
like a wave<br>
On the ground around<br>
your knees<br>
The birds like<br>
tender babies<br>
In your hands<br>
and the old men<br>
Playing checkers<br>
by the trees<br>
MacArthur&rsquo;s Park is<br>
melting in the dark<br>
All the sweet green<br>
icing flowing down<br>
Someone left the<br>
cake out in the rain<br>
I don&rsquo;t think<br>
I can take it<br>
&lsquo;Cause it took<br>
so long to bake it<br>
And<br>
I&rsquo;ll never have<br>
That recipe again<br>
oh no-</p>
<p>There will<br>
be another<br>
Song for me<br>
for I will sing it<br>
There will be another<br>
dream for me<br>
Someone will<br>
bring it<br>
I will drink the wine<br>
while it is warm<br>
And never<br>
let you catch me<br>
Looking at the sun<br>
and after<br>
All the loves<br>
of my life<br>
After all the loves<br>
of my life<br>
You&rsquo;ll still<br>
be the one<br>
I would take my life<br>
into my hands<br>
And I will use it<br>
I will in the worship<br>
In their eyes<br>
and I will lose it<br>
I will have the things<br>
that I desire<br>
And my passions<br>
flow like rivers<br>
Through the sky<br>
And after all<br>
The loves of my life<br>
After all the loves<br>
Of my life<br>
I&rsquo;ll be thinking<br>
Of you<br>
and wondering why-</p>
<p>MacArthur&rsquo;s Park is<br>
melting in the dark<br>
All the sweet<br>
green icing<br>
Flowing down<br>
someone left<br>
The cake out<br>
in the rain<br>
I don&rsquo;t think<br>
that I can take it<br>
&lsquo;Cause it took<br>
so long to bake it<br>
And I&rsquo;ll never have<br>
that recipe again-</p>
