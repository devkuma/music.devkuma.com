<p>What I&rsquo;ve got<br>
you&rsquo;ve got to<br>
Give it to<br>
your mamma<br>
What I&rsquo;ve got<br>
you&rsquo;ve got to<br>
Give it to<br>
your pappa<br>
What I&rsquo;ve got<br>
you&rsquo;ve got to<br>
Give it to<br>
your daughter<br>
You do a little<br>
dance and then<br>
You drink a<br>
little water<br>
What I&rsquo;ve got<br>
you&rsquo;ve got to<br>
Get it put it<br>
in you<br>
What I&rsquo;ve got<br>
you&rsquo;ve got to<br>
Get it put it<br>
in you<br>
What I&rsquo;ve got<br>
you&rsquo;ve got to<br>
Get it put it<br>
in you<br>
Reeling with<br>
the feeling<br>
Don&rsquo;t stop<br>
continue<br>
Realize I don&rsquo;t want<br>
to be a miser<br>
Confide wisely<br>
you&rsquo;ll be the wiser<br>
Young blood is<br>
the lovin&rsquo; upriser<br>
How come everybody<br>
wanna keep it<br>
Like the<br>
kaiser<br>
Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
I can&rsquo;t tell if I&rsquo;m a<br>
king pin or a pauper<br>
Greedy little people<br>
in a sea of distress<br>
Keep your more to<br>
receive your less<br>
Unimpressed by<br>
material excess<br>
Love is free love<br>
me say hell yes<br>
I&rsquo;m a low<br>
brow but I<br>
Rock a little<br>
know how<br>
No time for<br>
the piggies<br>
Or the<br>
hoosegow<br>
Get smart<br>
get down<br>
With the<br>
pow wow<br>
Never been a better<br>
time than right now<br>
Bob marley poet<br>
and a prophet<br>
Bob marley<br>
taught how to off it<br>
Bob marley walkin&rsquo;<br>
like he talk it<br>
Goodness me<br>
can&rsquo;t you see<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna<br>
cough it<br>
Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
Give it away<br>

Give it away now<br>
oh oh yeah<br>
Give it away<br>

Give it away<br>

Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
I can&rsquo;t tell if I&rsquo;m a<br>
king pin or a pauper</p>
<p>Lucky me swimmin&rsquo;<br>
in my ability<br>
Dancin&rsquo; down on<br>
life with agility<br>
Come and drink it up<br>
from my fertility<br>
Blessed with a bucket<br>
of lucky mobility<br>
My mom I love her<br>
&lsquo;cause she love me<br>
Long gone<br>
are the times<br>
When she<br>
scrub me<br>
Feelin&rsquo; good my<br>
brother gonna hug me<br>
Drink my juice<br>
lone chug-a-lug me<br>
There&rsquo;s a river born<br>
to be a giver<br>
Keep you warm won&rsquo;t<br>
let you shiver<br>
His heart is never<br>
gonna wither<br>
Come on everybody<br>
time to deliver<br>
Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
Give it away<br>
give it away<br>
Give it away<br>
now<br>
I can&rsquo;t tell if I&rsquo;m a<br>
king pin or a pauper</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve got<br>
