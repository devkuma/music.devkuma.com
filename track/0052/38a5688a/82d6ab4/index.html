    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=84922" target="_black">84922</a></p>
<p>Come to decide<br>
that the things<br>
That I tried were<br>
in my life just<br>
To get<br>
high on<br>
When I sit alone come<br>
get a little known<br>
But I need more than<br>
myself this time<br>
Step from the road<br>
to the sea to the sky<br>
And I do believe it<br>
we rely on<br>
When I lay it on come<br>
get to play it on<br>
All my life<br>
to sacrifice<br>
Hey oh<br>
listen what I say oh<br>
I got your hey oh now<br>
listen what I say oh<br>
When will I know that<br>
I really can&rsquo;t go<br>
To the well once<br>
more time to decide on<br>
When it&rsquo;s killing me<br>
when will I really see<br>
All that I need<br>
to look inside<br>
Come to believe that<br>
I better not leave<br>
Before I get my<br>
chance to ride<br>
When it&rsquo;s killing me<br>
what do I really need<br>
All that I need<br>
to look inside<br>
Hey oh<br>
listen what I say oh<br>
Come back and hey oh<br>
look at what I say oh<br>
The more I see<br>
the less I know<br>
The more I like to<br>
let it go hey oh whoa<br>
Deep beneath the cover<br>
of another<br>
Perfect wonder where<br>
it&rsquo;s so white as snow<br>
Privately divided by<br>
a world so undecided<br>
And there&rsquo;s<br>
nowhere to go<br>
In between the cover<br>
of another<br>
Perfect wonder and<br>
it&rsquo;s so white as snow<br>
Running through<br>
a field<br>
Where all my tracks<br>
will be concealed<br>
And there&rsquo;s<br>
nowhere to go</p>
<p>When to descend<br>
to amend for a friend<br>
All the channels<br>
that have broken down<br>
Now you bring it up<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna ring it up<br>
Just to hear<br>
you sing it out<br>
Step from the road<br>
to the sea to the sky<br>
And I do believe<br>
what we rely on<br>
When I lay it on<br>
come get to play it on<br>
All my life<br>
to sacrifice<br>
Hey oh<br>
listen what I say oh<br>
I got your hey oh<br>
listen what I say oh<br>
The more I see<br>
the less I know<br>
The more I like to<br>
let it go hey oh whoa<br>
Deep beneath the cover<br>
of another<br>
Perfect wonder where<br>
it&rsquo;s so white as snow<br>
Privately divided by<br>
a world so undecided<br>
And there&rsquo;s<br>
nowhere to go<br>
In between the cover<br>
of another<br>
Perfect wonder and<br>
it&rsquo;s so white as snow<br>
Running through<br>
a field<br>
Where all my tracks<br>
will be concealed<br>
And there&rsquo;s<br>
nowhere to go<br>
I said hey<br>
hey yeah<br>
Oh yeah<br>
tell my lord now<br>
Hey hey yeah oh yeah<br>
tell my lord now<br>
Deep beneath the cover<br>
of another<br>
Perfect wonder where<br>
it&rsquo;s so white as snow<br>
Privately divided by<br>
a world so undecided<br>
And there&rsquo;s<br>
nowhere to go<br>
Deep beneath the cover<br>
of another<br>
Perfect wonder where<br>
it&rsquo;s so white as snow<br>
Running through<br>
the field<br>
Where all my tracks<br>
will be concealed<br>
And there&rsquo;s<br>
nowhere to go<br>
I said hey<br>
oh yeah<br>
Oh yeah<br>
tell my lord now<br>
Hey hey yeah<br>
