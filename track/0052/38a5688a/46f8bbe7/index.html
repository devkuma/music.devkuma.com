<p>Can&rsquo;t stop addicted<br>
to the shin dig<br>
Cop top he says<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna win big<br>
Choose not a life<br>
of imitation<br>
Distant cousin<br>
to the reservation<br>
Defunk the pistol<br>
that you pay for<br>
This punk the feeling<br>
that you stay for<br>
In time I want to be<br>
your best friend<br>
Eastside love is<br>
living on the westend<br>
Knock out but boy<br>
you better come to<br>
Don&rsquo;t die you know<br>
the truth is some do<br>
Go write your message<br>
on the pavement<br>
Burnin&rsquo; so bright<br>
I wonder<br>
What the wave meant<br>
white heat<br>
Is screaming<br>
in the jungle<br>
Complete the motion<br>
if you stumble<br>
Go ask the dust<br>
for any answers<br>
Come back strong<br>
with 50 belly dancers<br>
The world I love<br>
the tears I drop<br>
To be part of<br>
the wave can&rsquo;t stop<br>
Ever wonder<br>
if it&rsquo;s all for you<br>
The world I love<br>
the trains I hop<br>
To be part of<br>
the wave can&rsquo;t stop<br>
Come and tell me<br>
when it&rsquo;s time to<br>
Sweetheart is bleeding<br>
in the snowcone<br>
So smart she&rsquo;s<br>
leading me to ozone<br>
Music the great<br>
communicator<br>
Use two sticks to<br>
make it in the nature<br>
I&rsquo;ll get you<br>
into penetration<br>
The gender<br>
of a generation<br>
The birth<br>
of every other nation<br>
Worth your weight<br>
the gold of meditation<br>
This chapter&rsquo;s going<br>
to be a close one<br>
Smoke rings I know<br>
your going to blow one<br>
All on a spaceship<br>
persevering<br>
Use my hands<br>
for everything<br>
But steering<br>
can&rsquo;t stop<br>
The spirits<br>
when they need you<br>
Mop tops are happy<br>
when they feed you<br>
J.Butterfly is<br>
in the treetop<br>
Birds that blow<br>
the meaning into bebop<br>
The world I love<br>
the tears I drop<br>
To be part of<br>
the wave can&rsquo;t stop<br>
Ever wonder<br>
if it&rsquo;s all for you<br>
The world I love<br>
the trains I hop<br>
To be part of<br>
the wave can&rsquo;t stop<br>
Come and tell me<br>
when it&rsquo;s time to<br>
Wait a minute<br>
I&rsquo;m passing out<br>
Win or lose<br>
just like you<br>
Far more<br>
shocking<br>
Than anything<br>
I ever knew<br>
How about you<br>
10 more reasons<br>
Why I need somebody<br>
new just like you<br>
Far more shocking<br>
than anything<br>
I ever knew<br>
right on cue</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t stop addicted<br>
to the shin dig<br>
Cop top he says<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna win big<br>
Choose not a life<br>
of imitation<br>
Distant cousin<br>
to the reservation<br>
Defunk the pistol<br>
that you pay for<br>
This punk the feeling<br>
that you stay for<br>
In time I want to be<br>
your best friend<br>
Eastside love is<br>
living on the westend<br>
Knock out but boy<br>
you better come to<br>
Don&rsquo;t die you know<br>
the truth is some do<br>
Go write your message<br>
on the pavement<br>
Burnin&rsquo;<br>
so bright<br>
I wonder<br>
what the wave meant<br>
Kick start<br>
the golden generator<br>
Sweet talk but<br>
don&rsquo;t intimidate her<br>
Can&rsquo;t stop the gods<br>
from engineering<br>
Feel no need<br>
for any interfering<br>
Your image<br>
in the dictionary<br>
This life is<br>
more than ordinary<br>
Can I get 2<br>
maybe even 3 of these<br>
Come from space<br>
to teach you<br>
Of the pliedes<br>
can&rsquo;t stop<br>
The spirits<br>
when they need you<br>
This life is more<br>
than just a read thru</p>
