<hr>
<p>Yeah Beyonce Perfect<br>
And Rihanna too<br>
Kanye&rsquo;s a genius<br>
And Drake&rsquo;s so cool<br>
All the Kardashian&rsquo;s China and Caitlyn too<br>
I want to be famous(gonna be famous)<br>
Just like you</p>
<p>I just wanna be rich<br>
In a big ole house<br>
At the top of the hill<br>
Somewhere in the mountains<br>
How does it feel to be rich?<br>
And everybody wanna take a pic<br>
Can&rsquo;t go out in public you sick<br>
But you know that everyone tryna take a flick<br>
Cause you pose<br>
And make sure you get my good side<br>
yeah yeah yeah<br>
Make sure you get my good side yeah yeah<br>
No wonder why girls don&rsquo;t wanna eat<br>
They had to go and cry themselves to sleep<br>
Cause every time they turn on the tv<br>
Every time they turn on the tv<br>
They wanna be like</p>
<p>Beyonce<br>
Cause she&rsquo;s perfect<br>
And Rihanna too<br>
Kanye a genius<br>
And Drake&rsquo;s so cool yeah<br>
All the Kardashians China and Caitlyn too<br>
I want to be famous just like you<br>
Yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>I just wanna be famous<br>
At the top of the A-list<br>
Everybody wanna know who you are<br>
and who you came with<br>
And you&rsquo;re only as famous as the person<br>
that you&rsquo;re fucking<br>
And you&rsquo;re only as big as your last hit<br>
But you ain&rsquo;t shit now cause that was last year<br>
You can&rsquo;t remember<br>
who you were before you got here<br>
And you don&rsquo;t wanna be alive if you&rsquo;re not here<br>
Who&rsquo;d you sell your soul to?<br>
And who controls you?<br>
And does the elevator own you?<br>
And when it&rsquo;s all over whatcha gonna do?<br>
Just look at Michael and Prince damn<br>
They kill my niggas over publishing<br>
Either the label or was it the government?<br>
Cause we all dolla signs dolla signs</p>
<p>I wanna get buff like Drake<br>
But I&rsquo;m too lazy to lose weight<br>
It&rsquo;s easy to get fit when you&rsquo;re rich<br>
If I was rich I&rsquo;d be mother fuckin ripped<br>
When you broke you eat like shit<br>
My diet consists of Arizona and chips<br>
You wanna look like Kim?<br>
How much you wanna spend?</p>
<p>Glow up Cali Glow up<br>
If your butt get any bigger<br>
you might just blow up<br>
Said she wanna be famous she wanna blow up<br>
Watch her whole Instagram followers<br>
go up go up<br>
My little niece wanna marry prince charming<br>
Buy a unicorn and a fucking Audi<br>
Whatcha wanna be when you grow up grow up?<br>
She said she wanna be Beyonce</p>
<p>Cause Beyonce<br>
She&rsquo;s perfect<br>
And Rihanna too<br>
Kanye a genius<br>
And Drake&rsquo;s so cool yeah<br>
All the Kardashian&rsquo;s China and Caitlyn too<br>
I want to be famous just like you<br>
I just wanna be rich</p>
