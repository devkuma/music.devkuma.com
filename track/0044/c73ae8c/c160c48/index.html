<p>Now that it&rsquo;s all<br>
said and done<br>
I can&rsquo;t believe you<br>
were the one<br>
To build me up<br>
and tear me down<br>
Like an old<br>
abandoned house<br>
What you said<br>
when you left<br>
Just left me cold<br>
and out of breath<br>
I fell too far<br>
was in way too deep<br>
Guess I let you<br>
get the best of me<br>
Well I never<br>
saw it coming<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
started running<br>
A long<br>
long time ago<br>
And I never thought<br>
I&rsquo;d doubt you<br>
I&rsquo;m better off<br>
without you<br>
More than you<br>
more than you know<br>
I&rsquo;m slowly<br>
getting closure<br>
I guess<br>
it&rsquo;s really over<br>
I&rsquo;m finally<br>
getting better<br>
And now I&rsquo;m picking<br>
up the pieces<br>
I&rsquo;m spending<br>
all of these years<br>
Putting my heart<br>
back together<br>
&lsquo;Cause the day<br>
I thought<br>
I&rsquo;d never get through<br>
I got over you<br>
You took a hammer<br>
to these walls<br>
Dragged the memories<br>
down the hall<br>
Packed your bags<br>
and walked away<br>
There was nothing<br>
I could say<br>
And when you slammed<br>
the front door shut<br>
A lot of<br>
others opened up<br>
So did my eyes<br>
so I could see<br>
That you never<br>
were the best for me~<br>
Well I never<br>
saw it coming<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
started running<br>
A long<br>
long time ago<br>
And I never thought<br>
I&rsquo;d doubt you<br>
I&rsquo;m better off<br>
without you<br>
More than you<br>
more than you know<br>
I&rsquo;m slowly<br>
getting closure<br>
I guess<br>
it&rsquo;s really over<br>
I&rsquo;m finally<br>
getting better<br>
And now I&rsquo;m picking<br>
up the pieces<br>
I&rsquo;m spending<br>
all of these years<br>
Putting my heart<br>
back together<br>
&lsquo;Cause the day<br>
I thought<br>
I&rsquo;d never get through<br>
I got over you<br>
Well I never<br>
saw it coming<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
started running<br>
A long<br>
long time ago<br>
And I never thought<br>
I&rsquo;d doubt you<br>
I&rsquo;m better off<br>
without you<br>
More than you<br>
more than you know<br>
Well I never<br>
saw it coming<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
started running<br>
A long<br>
long time ago<br>
And I never thought<br>
I&rsquo;d doubt you<br>
I&rsquo;m better off<br>
without you<br>
More than you<br>
more than you know<br>
I&rsquo;m slowly<br>
getting closure<br>
I guess<br>
it&rsquo;s really over<br>
I&rsquo;m finally<br>
getting better<br>
And now I&rsquo;m picking<br>
up the pieces<br>
I&rsquo;m spending<br>
all of these years<br>
Putting my heart<br>
back together<br>
Well I&rsquo;m putting<br>
my heart<br>
Back together<br>
&lsquo;cause I got over you<br>
Well I got over you~<br>
I got over you<br>
&lsquo;Cause the day<br>
I thought<br>
I&rsquo;d never get through<br>
I got over you</p>
