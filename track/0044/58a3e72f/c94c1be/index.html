    <p>작곡: SZA, Grant Lapo.., Drake / 작사: Words &amp; Music by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=99279" target="_black">99279</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know<br>
I don&rsquo;t know<br>
What&rsquo;s wrong<br>
with you girls<br>
I feel like<br>
y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t need love<br>
You need<br>
somebody<br>
Who could<br>
micromanage you<br>
You know<br>
what I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;<br>
Tell you right<br>
from wrong<br>
Who&rsquo;s smart<br>
from who&rsquo;s the fool<br>
Which utensil to use<br>
for which food like<br>
I got a schedule<br>
to attend to though<br>
I can&rsquo;t<br>
really<br>
You bxxxxxx really<br>
get carried away<br>
Makin&rsquo; mistakes then<br>
you beg me to stay<br>
Got me wiggin&rsquo; on you<br>
like I&rsquo;m Arrogant Tae<br>
You got my mind<br>
in a terrible place<br>
Whipped<br>
and chained you<br>
Like<br>
American slaves<br>
Act like you not used<br>
to Sheraton stays<br>
I met the nxxxx you<br>
thought could replace<br>
How were there even<br>
comparisons made<br>
Bxxxx<br>
next time<br>
I swear on<br>
my grandmother grave<br>
I&rsquo;m slimin&rsquo;<br>
you<br>
For them kid<br>
choices you made<br>
Slimin&rsquo; you out<br>
slimin&rsquo; you out<br>
Slimin&rsquo; you<br>
out<br>
Ayy<br>
this ain&rsquo;t the littest<br>
I could get on you<br>
bxxxxxx<br>
Send wires on wires on<br>
wires like Idris<br>
You lucky<br>
that<br>
I don&rsquo;t take back<br>
what was given<br>
I could have you<br>
on payment plan<br>
&lsquo;Til you&rsquo;re<br>
hundred and fifty<br>
And my slime<br>
right here<br>
She got some bars<br>
for y&rsquo;all nxxxxx<br>
So I&rsquo;ma fall back<br>
and let SZA talk her<br>
Sxxx<br>
for a minute<br>
Slimin&rsquo; you out<br>
slimin&rsquo; you out slime<br>
Dxxx these nxxxxx<br>
got me so twisted<br>
How the fxxx you<br>
so real<br>
But play bxxxx<br>
on my line<br>
I can feel<br>
what you&rsquo;re spinnin&rsquo;<br>
Got too much pride<br>
to let no burnt<br>
Nxxxx slime me out<br>
pull up go write about<br>
My night got time<br>
let&rsquo;s discuss<br>
All those lies about<br>
frontin&rsquo; out here<br>
Like<br>
you diggin&rsquo; me out<br>
And<br>
I ain&rsquo;t even cummin&rsquo;<br>
I&rsquo;m in and out<br>
and you ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;bout<br>
The sxxx<br>
you rappin&rsquo; about<br>
And I can spin a ho<br>
I&rsquo;m airin&rsquo; it out<br>
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; off<br>
like a sawed-off<br>
You tell these hoes<br>
you ain&rsquo;t cuddlin&rsquo;<br>
But with me<br>
you know<br>
You doin&rsquo;<br>
all that sxxx<br>
You tellin&rsquo; these hoes<br>
you ain&rsquo;t trickin&rsquo; off<br>
But with me you know<br>
I&rsquo;m gon&rsquo; get it all<br>
How you nxxxxx<br>
get so carried away<br>
Trippin&rsquo;<br>
when that dxxx is<br>
Barely third place<br>
fxxxxx out of pity<br>
It&rsquo;s cute<br>
that you lame<br>
Dip<br>
&lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s mid<br>
I can&rsquo;t fake<br>
like it&rsquo;s hangin&rsquo;<br>
Slimin&rsquo; you out<br>
I&rsquo;m slimin&rsquo; you out<br>
I&rsquo;m slimin&rsquo; you out<br>
oh woah woah<br>
Yeah January<br>
you pretend to see<br>
Life clearly yearly<br>
February is the time<br>
That you<br>
put the evil eye<br>
And the pride aside<br>
for the fantasy<br>
Of gettin&rsquo; married<br>
very scary<br>
March got you already<br>
second guessin&rsquo; titles<br>
April<br>
spring is here<br>
And just like a spring<br>
you start to spiral<br>
May brings<br>
some warmer days<br>
Poolside<br>
gettin&rsquo; very tan<br>
June have you movin&rsquo;<br>
ice cold<br>
Goin&rsquo; back and forth<br>
with a married man<br>
July that&rsquo;s when<br>
I found out you lied<br>
August<br>
it was baby this<br>
Baby that like you had<br>
your tubes tied<br>
September<br>
we fallin&rsquo; off<br>
But I&rsquo;m still the man<br>
you tryna win over<br>
October is<br>
all about me<br>
&lsquo;Cause your turn<br>
should&rsquo;ve been over<br>
November got you<br>
moodboardin&rsquo;<br>
For next year<br>
and you&rsquo;re single<br>
December<br>
the gift-givin&rsquo; month<br>
And now you wanna<br>
rekindle our year<br>
Tryna build trust<br>
showin&rsquo; me your DMs<br>
How they tryna<br>
bag you<br>
Ironic how the news<br>
I got about you<br>
Ended up<br>
bein&rsquo; bad news<br>
Get a nxxxx<br>
hit for fifty racks<br>
Girl the beef cost<br>
like it&rsquo;s wagyu<br>
Get a nxxxx hit<br>
I&rsquo;ll make his axx<br>
See the light<br>
like a half-moon<br>
Shout to QC<br>
pretty sure<br>
I made Pee M&rsquo;s<br>
like it&rsquo;s past noon<br>
All I really know is<br>
W&rsquo;s and M&rsquo;s<br>
Life lookin&rsquo;<br>
like a bathroom<br>
All I really<br>
know is M bags<br>
Like I drove through<br>
and ordered fast food<br>
Sayin&rsquo;<br>
that I&rsquo;m too guarded<br>
With<br>
my feelings<br>
Who the fxxx<br>
even asked you<br>
Seven bodyguards<br>
just in case somebody<br>
Really wanna try<br>
and crash through<br>
Don&rsquo;t know why<br>
I listen to you<br>
When I hear<br>
you talkin&rsquo; to me<br>
It&rsquo;s some<br>
half-truths<br>
If I don&rsquo;t pay<br>
your rent<br>
It end up<br>
like an old hairstyle<br>
Girl it&rsquo;s past due<br>
if I don&rsquo;t</p>
