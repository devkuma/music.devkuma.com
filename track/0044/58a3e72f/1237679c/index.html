  <meta name="description" content="It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine Last name ever first name greatest Like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothing To play with started off local But thanks to all the haters I know G4 pilots on a first name basis In your city faded off the brown Nino She insists she got more class we know Swimming in the money come and find me Nemo If I was at the club You know I balled chemo Drop the mixtape That xhit sounded like an album Whod a thought a country Wide tourd be the outcome Labels want my name Beside the X like Malcolm Everybody got a deal I did it without one Yeah xigga Im about my business Killing all these rappers You would swear I had a hit list Everyone who doubted me is Asking for forgiveness If you aint been a part of it At least you got to witness xitches It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Everever Mr West is in the building Aint no question who about to kill em I used to have hood dreams Big fame big chains I stuck my xick inside this life Until that xitch came I went hard all fall like the ball teams Just so I can make it rain all spring Yall seen my story my glory I had raped the game young You can call it statutory When a xigga blow up They gon build statues for me Old money Benjamin Button what nothing Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin You would think I ran the world Like Michelles husband You would think these xiggas know me When they really doesnt Like they was down with the old me no You xucking wasnt Youre such a xucking loser He didnt even go to class Bueller Trade the Grammy plaques Just to have my granny back Remember she had that bad hip Like a fanny pack chasing the stardom Will turn you to a maniac All the way in Hollywood And I cant even act They pull their cameras out And godxamn he snap I used to want this thing forever Yall can have it back It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine OK hello its the Martian Space Jam Jordans I want this xhit forever Wake up and smell the garden Fresher than the harvest Step up to the target if I had one guess Then I guess Im just New Orleans And I will never stop Like Im running from the cops Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur To the top life is such a xucking Roller coaster then it drops But what should I scream for This is my theme park my mind shine even When my thoughts seem dark Pistol on my side You dont wanna hear that thing talk Let the king talk check the price And pay attention Lil Wayne Thats what they gotta say or mention Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover Shhh my foots sleeping on the gas No brake pads no such thing as last uh It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine There they go packing stadiums As Shady spits his flow Nuts they go macadamian They go so ballistic whoa He can make them look like Bozos Hes wondering if he should spit this slow Xuck no go for broke His cup just runneth over oh no He aint had him a buzz like this Since the last time that he overdosed Theyve been waiting patiently For Pinocchio to poke his nose Back into the game and they know Rap will never be the same as before Bashing in the brains of these hoes And establishing the name as he goes The passion and the flame is ignited You cant put it out once we light it This xhit is exactly what the xuck That Im talking about when we riot You dealing with a few true villains Who stand inside of a booth truth spilling And spit true feelings until our tooth Fillings come flying up Out of our mouths now rewind it Pay back motherxucker for the way That you got at me hows it taste When I slap the taste out Your mouth with the bass so loud That it shakes the place Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case Youre thinking of saving face You aint gonna have no face to save By the time Im through With this place so Drake It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning

<p>It may not mean<br>
nothing to y&rsquo;all<br>
But understand nothing<br>
was done for me<br>
So I don&rsquo;t plan<br>
on stopping at all<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever mine<br>
ever mine<br>
I&rsquo;m shutting xhit down<br>
in the mall<br>
And telling every girl<br>
she the one for me<br>
And I ain&rsquo;t even<br>
planning to call<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever mine ever mine<br>
ever mine<br>
Last name ever<br>
first name greatest<br>
Like a sprained ankle<br>
boy I ain&rsquo;t nothing<br>
To play<br>
with started off local<br>
But thanks<br>
to all the haters<br>
I know G4 pilots<br>
on a first name basis<br>
In your city faded<br>
off the brown Nino<br>
She insists she got<br>
more class we know<br>
Swimming in the money<br>
come and find me Nemo<br>
If I was<br>
at the club<br>
You know I balled<br>
chemo<br>
Drop<br>
the mixtape<br>
That xhit sounded<br>
like an album<br>
Who&rsquo;d a thought<br>
a country<br>
Wide tour&rsquo;d<br>
be the outcome<br>
Labels<br>
want my name<br>
Beside<br>
the X like Malcolm<br>
Everybody got a deal<br>
I did it without one<br>
Yeah xigga<br>
I&rsquo;m about my business<br>
Killing<br>
all these rappers<br>
You would swear<br>
I had a hit list<br>
Everyone<br>
who doubted me is<br>
Asking<br>
for forgiveness<br>
If you ain&rsquo;t been<br>
a part of it<br>
At least you got<br>
to witness xitches<br>
It may not mean<br>
nothing to y&rsquo;all<br>
But understand nothing<br>
was done for me<br>
So I don&rsquo;t plan<br>
on stopping at all<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever mine<br>
ever mine<br>
I&rsquo;m shutting xhit down<br>
in the mall<br>
And telling every girl<br>
she the one for me<br>
And I ain&rsquo;t even<br>
planning to call<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever-ever Mr. West is<br>
in the building<br>
Ain&rsquo;t no question<br>
who about to kill &rsquo;em<br>
I used to have<br>
hood dreams<br>
Big fame<br>
big chains<br>
I stuck my xick<br>
inside this life<br>
Until<br>
that xitch came<br>
I went hard all fall<br>
like the ball teams<br>
Just so I can make it<br>
rain all spring<br>
Y&rsquo;all seen my story<br>
my glory<br>
I had raped<br>
the game young<br>
You can call it<br>
statutory<br>
When a xigga<br>
blow up<br>
They gon&rsquo; build<br>
statues for me<br>
Old money Benjamin<br>
Button what nothing<br>
Now super bad chicks<br>
giving me McLovin<br>
You would think<br>
I ran the world<br>
Like<br>
Michelle&rsquo;s husband<br>
You would think<br>
these xiggas know me<br>
When they really<br>
doesn&rsquo;t<br>
Like they was down<br>
with the old me no<br>
You xucking<br>
wasn&rsquo;t<br>
You&rsquo;re<br>
such a xucking loser<br>
He didn&rsquo;t even go<br>
to class Bueller<br>
Trade the Grammy<br>
plaques<br>
Just to have<br>
my granny back<br>
Remember she had<br>
that bad hip<br>
Like a fanny pack<br>
chasing the stardom<br>
Will turn you<br>
to a maniac<br>
All the way<br>
in Hollywood<br>
And<br>
I can&rsquo;t even act<br>
They pull<br>
their cameras out<br>
And godxamn<br>
he snap<br>
I used to want this<br>
thing forever<br>
Y&rsquo;all can<br>
have it back<br>
It may not mean<br>
nothing to y&rsquo;all<br>
But understand nothing<br>
was done for me<br>
So I don&rsquo;t plan<br>
on stopping at all<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever mine<br>
ever mine<br>
I&rsquo;m shutting xhit down<br>
in the mall<br>
And telling every girl<br>
she the one for me<br>
And I ain&rsquo;t even<br>
planning to call<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever mine ever mine<br>
ever mine<br>
OK hello<br>
it&rsquo;s the Martian<br>
Space Jam<br>
Jordans<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever<br>
Wake up<br>
and smell the garden<br>
Fresher<br>
than the harvest<br>
Step up to the target<br>
if I had one guess<br>
Then I guess<br>
I&rsquo;m just New Orleans<br>
And I will<br>
never stop<br>
Like I&rsquo;m running<br>
from the cops<br>
Hop up in my car<br>
and told my chauffeur<br>
To the top<br>
life is such a xucking<br>
Roller coaster<br>
then it drops<br>
But what should<br>
I scream for<br>
This is my theme park<br>
my mind shine even<br>
When my thoughts<br>
seem dark<br>
Pistol<br>
on my side<br>
You don&rsquo;t wanna hear<br>
that thing talk<br>
Let the king talk<br>
check the price<br>
And pay attention<br>
Lil Wayne<br>
That&rsquo;s what they gotta<br>
say or mention<br>
I&rsquo;m like Nevada in the<br>
middle of the summer<br>
I&rsquo;m resting<br>
in the lead<br>
I need a pillow<br>
and a cover<br>
Shhh my foot&rsquo;s<br>
sleeping on the gas<br>
No brake pads no such<br>
thing as last uh<br>
It may not mean<br>
nothing to y&rsquo;all<br>
But understand nothing<br>
was done for me<br>
So I don&rsquo;t plan<br>
on stopping at all<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever mine<br>
ever mine<br>
I&rsquo;m shutting xhit down<br>
in the mall<br>
And telling every girl<br>
she the one for me<br>
And I ain&rsquo;t even<br>
planning to call<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever mine ever mine<br>
ever mine<br>
There they go<br>
packing stadiums<br>
As Shady spits<br>
his flow<br>
Nuts they go<br>
macadamian<br>
They go so ballistic<br>
whoa<br>
He can make them<br>
look like Bozos<br>
He&rsquo;s wondering if he<br>
should spit this slow<br>
Xuck no<br>
go for broke<br>
His cup just<br>
runneth over oh no<br>
He ain&rsquo;t had<br>
him a buzz like this<br>
Since the last time<br>
that he overdosed<br>
They&rsquo;ve been waiting<br>
patiently<br>
For Pinocchio<br>
to poke his nose<br>
Back into the game<br>
and they know<br>
Rap will never<br>
be the same as before<br>
Bashing in the brains<br>
of these hoes<br>
And establishing<br>
the name as he goes<br>
The passion and<br>
the flame is ignited<br>
You can&rsquo;t put it out<br>
once we light it<br>
This xhit is exactly<br>
what the xuck<br>
That I&rsquo;m talking about<br>
when we riot<br>
You dealing with a few<br>
true villains<br>
Who stand inside of<br>
a booth truth spilling<br>
And spit true feelings<br>
until our tooth<br>
Fillings come<br>
flying up<br>
Out of our mouths<br>
now rewind it<br>
Pay back motherxucker<br>
for the way<br>
That you got at me<br>
how&rsquo;s it taste<br>
When I slap<br>
the taste out<br>
Your mouth<br>
with the bass so loud<br>
That it<br>
shakes the place<br>
I&rsquo;m Hannibal Lecter<br>
so just in case<br>
You&rsquo;re thinking<br>
of saving face<br>
You ain&rsquo;t gonna have<br>
no face to save<br>
By the time<br>
I&rsquo;m through<br>
With this place<br>
so Drake<br>
It may not mean<br>
nothing to y&rsquo;all<br>
But understand nothing<br>
was done for me<br>
So I don&rsquo;t plan<br>
on stopping at all<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever mine<br>
ever mine<br>
I&rsquo;m shutting xhit down<br>
in the mall<br>
And telling every girl<br>
she the one for me<br>
And I ain&rsquo;t even<br>
planning to call<br>
I want this xhit<br>
forever mine<br>
Ever mine ever mine<br>
ever mine</p>
