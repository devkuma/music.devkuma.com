Thousand men<br>

And one man led the<br>
way the others<br>
Followed by Genghis<br>
Khan (Ha hu ha)<br>
They galloped<br>
over mountains<br>
And desert sands<br>
They carried<br>
Desolation<br>
throughout the land<br>
And nothing<br>
there could<br>
Stop them in<br>
this world (Hu ha)<br>

When he lifts his<br>
Glass up in the air<br>
He was the greatest<br>
Lover and the<br>

Of his day<br>
(Ha hu ha)<br>
And we have heard that<br>
all the women<br>
Fell for him<br>
so they say<br>
(Ha hu ha)<br>
And he bred<br>
Seven children<br>
in one whole night<br>
He had his<br>
girls around him<br>
At his<br>
very sight<br>
And nothing<br>
that could<br>
Stop him in<br>
