    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=84891" target="_black">84891</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to<br>
lose my mind<br>
You&rsquo;ve been gone<br>
for so long<br>
I&rsquo;m running<br>
out of time<br>
I need a doctor<br>
call me a doctor<br>
I need a doctor<br>
doctor<br>
To bring me<br>
back to life<br>
I told<br>
the world<br>
One day<br>
I would pay it back<br>
Say it on tape<br>
and lay it record it<br>
So that one day<br>
I could play it back<br>
But I don&rsquo;t<br>
even know<br>
If I believe it<br>
when I&rsquo;m saying that<br>
Doubt startin&rsquo;<br>
to creep in<br>
Every day it&rsquo;s<br>
just so grey and black<br>
Hope I just need<br>
a ray of that<br>
&lsquo;Cause no one<br>
sees my vision<br>
When I play it<br>
for&rsquo;em<br>
They just say<br>
it&rsquo;s wack<br>
But they don&rsquo;t know<br>
what dope is<br>
And I don&rsquo;t know<br>
if I was awake<br>
Or asleep<br>
when I wrote this<br>
All I know is<br>
you came to me<br>
When I was<br>
at my lowest<br>
You picked me up<br>
breeding life in me<br>
I owe my life to you<br>
before the life of me<br>
I don&rsquo;t see why you<br>
don&rsquo;t see like I do<br>
But it just dawned<br>
on me you lost a son<br>
Demons fight in you<br>
it&rsquo;s dark<br>
Let me turn on<br>
the lights<br>
And brighten me<br>
and enlighten you<br>
I don&rsquo;t think you<br>
realize<br>
What you mean to me<br>
not the slightest clue<br>
&lsquo;Cause me and you<br>
we&rsquo;re like a crew<br>
I was<br>
like your sidekick<br>
You gon&rsquo;<br>
either wanna fight<br>
When I get off<br>
this xucking mic<br>
Or you gon&rsquo; hug me<br>
but I&rsquo;m out of options<br>
Just nothing else<br>
I can do cause<br>
I&rsquo;m about to<br>
lose my mind<br>
You&rsquo;ve been gone<br>
for so long<br>
I&rsquo;m running<br>
out of time<br>
I need a doctor<br>
call me a doctor<br>
I need a doctor<br>
doctor<br>
To bring me<br>
back to life<br>
It hurts when I see<br>
you struggle<br>
You come to me<br>
with ideas<br>
You say<br>
they&rsquo;re just pieces<br>
So I&rsquo;m<br>
puzzled<br>
&lsquo;Cause the shit<br>
I hear is crazy<br>
But you&rsquo;re<br>
either getting lazy<br>
Or you don&rsquo;t believe<br>
in you no more<br>
Seems like your own<br>
opinions<br>
Not one<br>
you can form<br>
Can&rsquo;t make<br>
a decision<br>
You keep questioning<br>
yourself<br>
Second guessing<br>
and it&rsquo;s almost<br>
Like you&rsquo;re begging<br>
for my help<br>
Like I&rsquo;m<br>
your leader<br>
Your supposed to<br>
xucking be my mentor<br>
I can endure<br>
no more<br>
I demand you remember<br>
who you are<br>
It was you<br>
who believed in me<br>
When everyone was<br>
telling you<br>
Don&rsquo;t sign me<br>
everyone<br>
At the xucking label<br>
let&rsquo;s tell the truth<br>
You risked your career<br>
for me<br>
I know it<br>
as well as you<br>
Nobody wanted to xuck<br>
with the white boy<br>
Dre I&rsquo;m crying<br>
in this booth<br>
You saved my life<br>
now maybe<br>
It&rsquo;s my time<br>
to save yours<br>
But I can never<br>
repay you<br>
What you did for me is<br>
way more<br>
But I ain&rsquo;t<br>
giving up faith<br>
And you ain&rsquo;t<br>
giving up on me<br>
Get up Dre<br>
I&rsquo;m dying I need you<br>
Come back<br>
for xuck&rsquo;s sake<br>
I&rsquo;m about to<br>
lose my mind<br>
You&rsquo;ve been gone<br>
for so long<br>
I&rsquo;m running<br>
out of time<br>
I need a doctor<br>
call me a doctor<br>
I need a doctor<br>
doctor<br>
To bring me<br>
back to life<br>
Bring me back to life<br>
bring me back to life<br>
I need a doctor<br>
doctor<br>
To bring me<br>
back to life<br>
It literally feels<br>
like a lifetime ago<br>
But I still remember<br>
the shit<br>
Like it was<br>
just yesterday though<br>
You walked in<br>
yellow jumpsuit<br>
Whole room<br>
cracked jokes<br>
Once you got<br>
inside the booth<br>
Told you<br>
like smoke<br>
Went through friends<br>
some of them I put on<br>
But they<br>
just left<br>
They said they was<br>
riding to the death<br>
But where the xuck are<br>
they now<br>
Now that<br>
I need them<br>
I don&rsquo;t see<br>
none of them<br>
All I see is<br>
Slim<br>
Xuck all you<br>
fair-weather friends<br>
All I need is<br>
him<br>
Xucking<br>
backstabbers<br>
When the chips were<br>
down<br>
You just laughed<br>
at us<br>
Now you &lsquo;bout<br>
to feel the xucking<br>
Wrath of aftermath<br>
faggots<br>
You gon&rsquo; see us<br>
in our lab jackets<br>
And ask<br>
where the xuck we been<br>
You can kiss<br>
my indecisive ass<br>
Crack maggots<br>
and the crackers&rsquo;s ass<br>
Little crack a jack<br>
beat making wack math<br>
Backwards producers<br>
I&rsquo;m back bastards<br>
One more CD<br>
and then<br>
I&rsquo;m packing up my bags<br>
and as I leave<br>
And I guarantee<br>
they&rsquo;ll scream<br>
Dre don&rsquo;t leave us<br>
like that man cause<br>
I&rsquo;m about to<br>
lose my mind<br>
You&rsquo;ve been gone<br>
for so long<br>
I&rsquo;m running<br>
out of time<br>
I need a doctor<br>
call me a doctor<br>
I need a doctor<br>
doctor<br>
To bring me<br>
back to life</p>
