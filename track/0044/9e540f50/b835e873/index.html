<p>Didn&rsquo;t know what time<br>
it was the lights<br>
Were low I leaned<br>
back on my radio<br>
Some cat was<br>
layin&rsquo; down some<br>
Rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll<br>
&rsquo;lotta soul he said<br>
Then the loud sound<br>
did seem to fade<br>
Came back like a<br>
slow voice on a<br>
Wave of phase<br>
that weren&rsquo;t no DJ<br>
That was<br>
hazy cosmic jive<br>
There&rsquo;s a starman<br>
waiting in the sky<br>
He&rsquo;d like to come<br>
and meet us<br>
But he thinks<br>
he&rsquo;d blow our minds<br>
There&rsquo;s a starman<br>
waiting in the sky<br>
He&rsquo;s told us<br>
not to blow it<br>
Cause he knows<br>
it&rsquo;s all worthwhile<br>
He told me let the<br>
children lose it<br>
Let the<br>
children use it<br>
Let all the<br>
children boogie</p>
<p>I had phone someone so<br>
I picked on you<br>
Hey that&rsquo;s far out<br>
so you heard him too<br>
Switch on the TV<br>
we may<br>
Pick him up on<br>
channel two<br>
Look out your window<br>
I can see his light<br>
If we can sparkle<br>
he may land tonight<br>
Don&rsquo;t tell<br>
your poppa<br>
Or he&rsquo;ll get us<br>
locked up in fright<br>
There&rsquo;s a starman<br>
waiting in the sky<br>
He&rsquo;d like to<br>
come and meet us<br>
But he thinks<br>
he&rsquo;d blow our minds<br>
There&rsquo;s a starman<br>
waiting in the sky<br>
He&rsquo;s told us<br>
not to blow it<br>
Cause he knows<br>
it&rsquo;s all worthwhile<br>
He told me let the<br>
children lose it<br>
Let the<br>
children use it<br>
Let all the<br>
children boogie<br>
