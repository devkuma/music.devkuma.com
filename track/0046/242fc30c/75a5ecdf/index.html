<hr>
<p>You said that you heard<br>
This could be good inspiration, I laughed<br>
mostly from discomfort<br>
and stopped making eye contact<br>
I hope your feelings<br>
weren’t hurt too bad when I did that<br>
people tend to laugh<br>
when you say a funny joke<br>
or just a quote<br>
like one from the office<br>
where I kind of expected<br>
like hey can we talk<br>
I haven’t been that happy<br>
It’s over</p>
<p>so don’t try to change my mind<br>
we’ve done this 3 times now<br>
and I think we’re both ready for a change<br>
in both of our lives<br>
I’ll always care about you<br>
but it can’t be in the same way<br>
that’s just not how things work</p>
<p>you said that your so glad<br>
that we spent the time the we did together<br>
I agreed completely and cried in elation<br>
that we’re on the same page<br>
first time in a long f**king while<br>
people tend to change<br>
when you get them thinking<br>
they did something wrong<br>
even when they didn’t,<br>
even when you tell them<br>
they’re perfect<br>
they’re welcome to come by to your house<br>
any time</p>
<p>so don’t try and change my heart<br>
this is the part where you leave<br>
with a kiss on the cheek not the lips<br>
and it breaks my heart<br>
to see you frown<br>
but it hurts even more<br>
when I see you smile<br>
at least for a while<br>
wish we could talk on the phone<br>
at least for a while</p>
<p>got a feeling<br>
I’ll feel much better<br>
though might take a while<br>
maybe when I’m older<br>
maybe when your older<br>
so old we buy coffee together or separate<br>
just old enough that we’re still friends&hellip;</p>
