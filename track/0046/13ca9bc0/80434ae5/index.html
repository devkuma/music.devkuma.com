<p>You guys</p>
<p>do not notice</p>
<p>That we are gifted</p>
<p>just by being humans</p>
<p>We are</p>
<p>absolute predators</p>
<p>We do not even</p>
<p>have any enemies</p>
<p>Maybe there are</p>
<p>other animals</p>
<p>Watching us</p>
<p>and thinking that</p>
<p>Someday &ldquo;we will</p>
<p>beat them down&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh We have the brains</p>
<p>to think hard</p>
<p>Wear</p>
<p>our favorite clothes</p>
<p>We are</p>
<p>at no doubt</p>
<p>Human beings</p>
<p>Many small lives</p>
<p>They were born</p>
<p>[They were born]</p>
<p>With the fate</p>
<p>[with the fate]</p>
<p>Of dying for someone</p>
<p>A human baby</p>
<p>When will</p>
<p>they find out</p>
<p>That at the point</p>
<p>they were born, we are</p>
<p>[We are winners]</p>
<p>(the) winners of Earth<br>

<p>For what have I</p>
<p>been living for?</p>
<p>When will I find out</p>
<p>the answer?</p>
<p>An answer</p>
<p>that is only for you</p>
<p>What will myself</p>
<p>and (the)</p>
<p>First scenery I saw</p>
<p>Look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my face,</p>
<p>my face</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>I read this inside</p>
<p>The book</p>
<p>I read before</p>
<p>[The book</p>
<p>I read before]</p>
<p>According</p>
<p>(to) Maslow</p>
<p>[According</p>
<p>(to) Maslow]</p>
<p>There are five steps</p>
<p>(in a) human&rsquo;s desire</p>
<p>To live</p>
<p>a long long life</p>
<p>To stay safe</p>
<p>and receive [Baby]</p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>from others</p>
<p>To get respect from</p>
<p>[Baby]</p>
<p>Others, To get closer</p>
<p>[Yeah]</p>
<p>To your ideal</p>
<p>[Yeah]</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it said</p>
<p>[Yeah]</p>
<p>No matter how hard</p>
<p>other animals try,</p>
<p>They probably can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go over the first step</p>
<p>That is</p>
<p>how intelligent we are</p>
<p>And, filled</p>
<p>with greed</p>
<p>But that is</p>
<p>probably</p>
<p>Why we can still</p>
<p>live on the top</p>
<p>Of the food chain</p>
<p>in this blue planet</p>
<p>Although we have</p>
<p>weak bodies ah<br>
