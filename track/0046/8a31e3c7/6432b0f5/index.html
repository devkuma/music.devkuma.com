<p>Whenever sang my songs</p>
<p>on the stage on my own</p>
<p>Whenever said</p>
<p>my words</p>
<p>Wishing they</p>
<p>would be heard</p>
<p>I saw you smiling</p>
<p>at me</p>
<p>Was it real</p>
<p>or just my fantasy</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d always be there</p>
<p>in the corner</p>
<p>Of this tiny</p>
<p>little bar</p>
<p>My last night</p>
<p>here for you</p>
<p>Same old songs</p>
<p>just once more</p>
<p>My last night</p>
<p>here with you</p>
<p>Maybe yes</p>
<p>maybe no</p>
<p>I kind of liked it</p>
<p>your way</p>
<p>How you shyly</p>
<p>placed your eyes on me</p>
<p>Oh did you ever know</p>
<p>that I had mine on you</p>
<p>Darling so there</p>
<p>you are</p>
<p>With that look</p>
<p>on your face</p>
<p>As if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never hurt</p>
<p>As if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never down</p>
<p>Shall I be</p>
<p>the one for you</p>
<p>Who pinches you</p>
<p>softly but sure</p>
<p>If frown is</p>
<p>shown then</p>
<p>I will know that</p>
<p>you are no dreamer-</p>
<p>So let me come to you</p>
<p>close as I wanna be</p>
<p>Close enough</p>
<p>for me</p>
<p>To feel your heart</p>
<p>beating fast</p>
<p>And stay there</p>
<p>as I whisper</p>
<p>How I loved your</p>
<p>peaceful eyes on me</p>
<p>Did you ever know</p>
<p>that I had mine on you</p>
<p>Darling so share</p>
<p>with me</p>
<p>Your love</p>
<p>if you have enough</p>
<p>Your tears if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>holding back</p>
<p>Or pain if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it is</p>
<p>How can I</p>
<p>let you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more</p>
<p>than the dress</p>
<p>And the voice</p>
<p>just reach me out then</p>
<p>You will know that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not dreaming</p>
<p>Darling so there</p>
<p>you are</p>
<p>With that look</p>
<p>on your face</p>
<p>As if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never hurt</p>
<p>As if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never down</p>
<p>Shall I be</p>
<p>the one for you</p>
<p>Who pinches you</p>
<p>softly but sure</p>
<p>If frown is</p>
<p>shown then</p>
<p>I will know that</p>
<p>you are no dreamer-</p>
