    <p>I think I talk about you<br>
every time you walk out the door<br>
I told my mom about you<br>
Damn I&rsquo;ve never done that before<br>
I&rsquo;d break his heart I&rsquo;d make some art<br>
And then he&rsquo;d call me a horrible person<br>
But now I&rsquo;m thinking &lsquo;bout you every time<br>

I wrap my arms around you<br>
even then you&rsquo;re not close enough<br>
You&rsquo;re on my tongue you&rsquo;re in my lungs<br>
You call me yours and it sucks cause it&rsquo;s working<br>
I brace for the damage<br>
You&rsquo;re perfect I panic<br>
So happy it&rsquo;s tragic<br>
Yeah I want you like that<br>
Don&rsquo;t freak out I&rsquo;m nervous<br>
I&rsquo;ll break us on purpose<br>
I&rsquo;m fucked but it&rsquo;s worth it<br>
Yeah I want you like that<br>
The way you look at me you&rsquo;re good to me<br>
don&rsquo;t know what this is<br>
Not used to honesty and honestly<br>
it&rsquo;s making me sick<br>
It&rsquo;s weird you treat me like a person<br>
and you don&rsquo;t try to fix me<br>
Just wanna be with me<br>
But you&rsquo;re tracing every line of my tattoos<br>
Wasting all our time in your bedroom<br>
Make it out alive I don&rsquo;t want to<br>
Cause I want you yeah<br>
I brace for the damage<br>
You&rsquo;re perfect I panic<br>
So happy it&rsquo;s tragic<br>
Yeah I want you like that<br>
Don&rsquo;t freak out I&rsquo;m nervous<br>
I&rsquo;ll break us on purpose<br>
I&rsquo;m fucked but it&rsquo;s worth it<br>
Yeah I want you like that<br>

Yeah I want you like that<br>
I brace for the damage<br>
