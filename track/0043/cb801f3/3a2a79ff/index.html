    <p>작곡: Sung by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=8794" target="_black">8794</a></p>
<p>You walked<br>
into the party<br>
Like you were<br>
walking onto a yacht<br>
Your hat strategically<br>
dipped below one eye<br>
Your scart<br>
it was apricot<br>
You had one eye<br>
in the mirror<br>
As you watched<br>
yourself gavotte<br>
And all the girls<br>
dreamed that they&rsquo;d<br>
Be your partner<br>
they&rsquo;d be<br>
Your partner and<br>
you&rsquo;re so vain<br>
You probably<br>
think this song<br>
Is about you<br>
you&rsquo;re so vain<br>
I&rsquo;ll bet you<br>
think this song<br>
Is about you<br>
don&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t you?<br>
You had me several<br>
years ago<br>
When I was still<br>
quite naive<br>
Well you said<br>
that we made<br>
Such a<br>
pretty pair<br>
And that you would<br>
never leave<br>
But you gave away<br>
the things<br>
You loved and one of<br>
them was me<br>
I had some dreams<br>
they were clouds<br>
In my coffee clouds<br>
in my coffee and<br>
You&rsquo;re so vain<br>
you probably<br>
Think this song is<br>
about you<br>
You&rsquo;re so vain<br>
I&rsquo;ll bet you<br>
Think this song is<br>
about you<br>
Don&rsquo;t you?<br>
Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I had some dreams<br>
they were clouds<br>
In my coffee clouds<br>
in my coffee and<br>
You&rsquo;re so vain<br>
you probably<br>
Think this song is<br>
about you<br>
You&rsquo;re so vain<br>
I&rsquo;ll bet you<br>
Think this song is<br>
about you<br>
Don&rsquo;t you?<br>
Don&rsquo;t you?<br>
Well I hear<br>
went up to saratoga<br>
And your horse<br>
naturally won<br>
Then you flew your<br>
lear jet up to<br>
Nova scotia<br>
to see the<br>
Total eclipse<br>
of the sun<br>
Well you&rsquo;re<br>
where you<br>
should be all the time<br>
and when you&rsquo;re not<br>
You&rsquo;re with<br>
some underworld<br>
Spy or the wife<br>
of a close friend<br>
Wife of a close<br>
friend and<br>
You&rsquo;re so vain<br>
you probably<br>
Think this song is<br>
about you<br>
You&rsquo;re so vain<br>
I&rsquo;ll bet you<br>
Think this song is<br>
about you<br>
Don&rsquo;t you?<br>
Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so vain<br>
you probably<br>
Think this song is<br>
about you<br>
You&rsquo;re so vain<br>
you probably<br>
Think this song is<br>
about you<br>
You&rsquo;re so vain<br>
you probably<br>
Think this song is<br>
about-</p>
