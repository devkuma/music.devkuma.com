<p>Oh I I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
It must have been<br>
something you said<br>
I just died<br>
in your arms tonight-</p>
<p>I keep looking for<br>
something I can&rsquo;t get<br>
Broken hearts<br>
lie all around me<br>
And I don&rsquo;t see<br>
an easy way<br>
To get out of this<br>
her diary it sits but<br>
On bedside table<br>
the curtains<br>
Are closed<br>
the cats in the cradle<br>
Who would&rsquo;ve<br>
thought that<br>
A boy like me<br>
could come to this<br>
Oh I I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
It must&rsquo;ve been<br>
something you said<br>
I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
Oh I I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
It must&rsquo;ve been<br>
some kind of kiss<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
walked away<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
walked away-</p>
<p>Is there any<br>
just cause for<br>
Feeling like this<br>
on the surface<br>
I&rsquo;m a name on a list<br>
I try to be discreet<br>
But then blow it<br>
again<br>
I&rsquo;ve lost and found<br>
it&rsquo;s my final mistake<br>
She&rsquo;s loving by proxy<br>
no give and all take<br>
&lsquo;Cos I&rsquo;ve been<br>
thrilled<br>
To fantasy one<br>
too many times<br>
Oh I I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
It must&rsquo;ve been<br>
something you said<br>
I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
Oh I I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
It must&rsquo;ve been<br>
some kind of kiss<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
walked away<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
walked away<br>
It was a long<br>
hot night<br>
She made it easy<br>
she made it feel right<br>
But now it&rsquo;s over<br>
the moment has gone<br>
I followed my hands<br>
not my head<br>
I know<br>
I was wrong-</p>
<p>Oh I I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
It must&rsquo;ve been<br>
something you said<br>
I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
Oh I I just died<br>
in your arms tonight<br>
It must&rsquo;ve been<br>
some kind of kiss<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
walked away<br>
I should&rsquo;ve<br>
walked away-</p>
