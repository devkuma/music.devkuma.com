<p>I don&rsquo;t see<br>
how you can hate<br>
From outside<br>
of the club<br>
You can&rsquo;t even get in<br>
ah ha ha ha ha leggo<br>
Yellow model chick<br>
yellow bottle sipping<br>
Yellow Lamborghini<br>
yellow top missing<br>
Yeah yeah that shit<br>
look like a toupee<br>
I get what you get in<br>
10 years in 2 days<br>
Ladies love me<br>
I&rsquo;m on my Cool J<br>
If you get what I get<br>
xuck what you say<br>
She wax it all off<br>
Mr. Miyagi<br>
And them suicide doors<br>
Harikari<br>
Look at me now<br>
look at me now oh<br>
I&rsquo;m getting<br>
paper<br>
Look at me now oh<br>
look at me now yeah<br>
Fresher<br>
than a motherxucker<br>
Lil nigga<br>
bigger than gorilla<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m killing<br>
every nigga<br>
That try to be<br>
on my shit<br>
Better cuff your chick<br>
if you with her<br>
I can get her<br>
and she accidentally<br>
Slip and fall<br>
on my xick<br>
Oops I said<br>
on my xick<br>
I ain&rsquo;t really mean<br>
to say on my xick<br>
But since we talking<br>
about my xick<br>
All of you haters<br>
say hi to it I&rsquo;m done<br>
Ayo Breezy<br>
let me show you<br>
How to keep<br>
the dice rolling<br>
When your doing that<br>
thing over there homie<br>
Ay(ay ay ay ay ay ay<br>
ay ay ay ay ay)<br>
(Let&rsquo;s go)&lsquo;cause I<br>
feel like I&rsquo;m running<br>
And I&rsquo;m feeling<br>
like I gotta get away<br>
Get away get away<br>
better know that<br>
I don&rsquo;t and I won&rsquo;t<br>
ever stop<br>
&lsquo;Cause you know<br>
I gotta win<br>
Every day day<br>
(go)<br>
See they really really<br>
wanna pop me(pop)<br>
Just know that you<br>
will never flop me(oh)<br>
And I know that I can<br>
be a little cocky(no)<br>
You ain&rsquo;t never<br>
gonna stop me<br>
Every time<br>
I come<br>
A nigga gotta set it<br>
then I got it going<br>
Then I gotta get it<br>
then I gotta blow<br>
And then I gotta<br>
shudder<br>
Any little<br>
thing<br>
A nigga think<br>
that he be doing<br>
&lsquo;Cause it doesn&rsquo;t<br>
matter<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m gonna<br>
Da Da Da Da<br>
Then I&rsquo;m gonna<br>
murder<br>
Everything<br>
and anything<br>
A badaboom<br>
a badabing<br>
I gotta do<br>
a lot of things<br>
And make it clearer<br>
to a couple niggas<br>
That I&rsquo;m always<br>
winning<br>
And I gotta<br>
get it again<br>
And again<br>
and again<br>
And I be doing it<br>
to death<br>
And now I move<br>
a little foul<br>
A nigga better<br>
call a ref<br>
And everybody knows<br>
my style<br>
And niggas know<br>
that I&rsquo;m the best<br>
When I come<br>
to doing this<br>
And I be banging<br>
on my chest<br>
And I bang<br>
in the east<br>
And I&rsquo;m banging<br>
in the west<br>
And I come<br>
to give you more<br>
And I will never<br>
give you less<br>
You will hear it<br>
in the street<br>
Or you can read it<br>
in the press<br>
Do you really<br>

See the way we on<br>

In the race<br>

To keep up<br>

We struggling<br>
and hustling<br>
And sending in<br>
and getting in<br>
And always gotta<br>

Take it<br>
to another place<br>
Gotta taste it<br>
and I gotta grab it<br>
And I gotta cut all<br>

Just to be at<br>
the top of the throne<br>
Better know I gotta<br>
