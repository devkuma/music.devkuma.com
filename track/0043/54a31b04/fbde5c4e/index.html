<p>Tell me who do you<br>
think you see<br>
You&rsquo;re standing<br>
in your corner<br>
Looking out<br>
on me<br>
You think<br>
I&rsquo;m so predictable<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think I am<br>
Looks can be deceiving<br>
better guess again<br>
Tell me what you see<br>
when you look at me<br>
You&rsquo;re probably<br>
thinking<br>
That I want<br>
those things<br>
Cash cars<br>
diamond rings<br>
Thinkin&rsquo; on my side<br>
the grass is green<br>
But you don&rsquo;t know<br>
where I have been<br>
I could be a wolf<br>
in disguise<br>
I could be an angel<br>
in your eyes<br>
Never judge a book<br>
by its cover<br>
I could be a crook<br>
or your lover<br>
I could be the one<br>
or the other<br>
If you&rsquo;d look beneath<br>
you&rsquo;d discover<br>
You just<br>
don&rsquo;t know me<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think you see<br>
You&rsquo;re standing<br>
in your corner<br>
Looking out<br>
on me<br>
You think<br>
I&rsquo;m so predictable<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think I am<br>
Looks can be deceiving<br>
better guess again<br>
Tell me what you see<br>
when you look at me<br>
You look at your<br>
neighbor thinking<br>
What a guy<br>
cuz he&rsquo;s got a 9 to 5<br>
And I bet<br>
that you don&rsquo;t realize<br>
He stalks you while<br>
you sleep at night<br>
But you&rsquo;re scared of<br>
the homeless guy<br>
Think he&rsquo;s gonna wanna<br>
start a fight<br>
Never judge a book<br>
by its cover<br>
I could be a crook<br>
or your lover<br>
I could be the one<br>
or the other<br>
If you&rsquo;d look beneath<br>
you&rsquo;d discover<br>
You just<br>
don&rsquo;t know me<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think you see<br>
You&rsquo;re standing<br>
in your corner<br>
Looking out<br>
on me<br>
You think<br>
I&rsquo;m so predictable<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think I am<br>
Looks can be deceiving<br>
better guess again<br>
Tell me what you see<br>
when you look at me<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think you see<br>
You&rsquo;re standing<br>
in your corner<br>
Looking out<br>
on me<br>
You think<br>
I&rsquo;m so predictable<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think I am<br>
Looks can be deceiving<br>
better guess again<br>
Tell me what you see<br>
when you look at me</p>
<p>Now tell me who do you<br>
think I am huh<br>
You don&rsquo;t<br>
even know me<br>
Well did you<br>
think about this<br>
I could be a crook<br>
or your lover<br>
I could be the one<br>
or the other<br>
If you&rsquo;d look beneath<br>
you&rsquo;d discover<br>
You just<br>
don&rsquo;t know me<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think you see<br>
You&rsquo;re standing<br>
in your corner<br>
Looking out<br>
on me<br>
You think<br>
I&rsquo;m so predictable<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think I am<br>
Looks can be deceiving<br>
better guess again<br>
Tell me what you see<br>
when you look at me<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think you see<br>
You&rsquo;re standing<br>
in your corner<br>
Looking out<br>
on me<br>
You think<br>
I&rsquo;m so predictable<br>
Tell me who do you<br>
think I am<br>
Looks can be deceiving<br>
better guess again<br>
Tell me what you see<br>
when you look at me</p>
