<p>There once was a king<br>
who called<br>
For the spring<br>
for his world<br>
Was still covered<br>
with snow<br>
But the spring<br>
had not been for<br>
He was wicked and mean<br>
in his winter fields<br>
Nothing would grow<br>
and when a traveller<br>
Called seeking help<br>
at the door<br>
Only food and a bed<br>
for a night<br>
He ordered his slave<br>
to turn her away<br>
The girl with April<br>
in her eyes<br>
Ah- ah- ah-<br>
ah- ah- ah-</p>
<p>Oh- on and on<br>
she goes<br>
Through the<br>
winter&rsquo;s night<br>
The wild wind<br>
and the snow<br>
Hi- on and on<br>
she rides<br>
Someone help<br>
the girl<br>
With April<br>
in her eyes-</p>
<p>She rode<br>
through the night<br>
Till she came<br>
to the light<br>
Of a humble man&rsquo;s home<br>
in the woods<br>
He brought her inside<br>
by the firelight<br>
She died<br>
and he buried her<br>
Gently and good<br>
oh the morning was<br>
Bright all the world<br>
snow white<br>
But when he came<br>
to the place<br>
Where she lay<br>
his field was ablaze<br>
With flowers<br>
on the grave<br>
Of the girl with April<br>
in her eyes<br>
Ah- ah- ah-<br>
ah- ah- ah-</p>
<p>Oh- on and on<br>
she goes<br>
Through the<br>
winter&rsquo;s night<br>
The wild wind<br>
and the snow<br>
Hi- on and on<br>
she flies<br>
She is gone<br>
the girl with April<br>
In her eyes<br>
ah-</p>
