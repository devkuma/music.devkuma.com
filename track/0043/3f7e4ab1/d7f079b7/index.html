<p>There were nights<br>
when the wind<br>
Was so cold<br>
that my body<br>
Froze in bed<br>
if I just listened<br>
To it right outside<br>
the window<br>
There were days<br>
when the sun<br>
Was so cruel<br>
that all the tears<br>
Turned to dust<br>
and I just knew<br>
My eyes were<br>
drying up forever<br>
I finished crying<br>
in the instant<br>
That you left<br>
and I can&rsquo;t remember<br>
Where or<br>
when or how<br>
And I vanished<br>
every memory<br>
You and I<br>
had ever made<br>
But when you touch me<br>
like this<br>
And you hold me<br>
like that<br>
I just have<br>
to admit<br>
That it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me<br>
When I touch you<br>
like this<br>
And I hold you<br>
like that<br>
It&rsquo;s so hard<br>
to believe<br>
But it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me<br>
It&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back<br>
It&rsquo;s all coming<br>
back to me now<br>
There were<br>
moments of gold<br>
And there were<br>
flashes of light<br>
There were things<br>
I&rsquo;d never do again<br>
But then they&rsquo;d<br>
always seemed right<br>
There were nights of<br>
endless pleasure<br>
It was more than<br>
any laws allow<br>
Baby Baby If I kiss<br>
you like this<br>
And if you whisper<br>
like that<br>
It was lost<br>
long ago<br>
But it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me<br>
If you want me<br>
like this<br>
And if you need me<br>
like that<br>
It was dead<br>
long ago<br>
But it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me<br>
It&rsquo;s so hard<br>
to resist<br>
And it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me<br>
I can barely<br>
recall<br>
But it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me now</p>
<p>But you were history<br>
with the slamming<br>
Of the door<br>
and I made myself<br>
So strong again<br>
somehow<br>
And I never wasted<br>
any of my time<br>
On you since then<br>
but if I touch you<br>
Like this<br>
and if you kiss me<br>
Like that<br>
it was so long ago<br>
But it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me<br>
If you touch me<br>
like this<br>
And if I kiss you<br>
like that<br>
It was gone<br>
with the wind<br>
But it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me<br>
It&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back<br>
It&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me now<br>
There were<br>
moments of gold<br>
And there were<br>
flashes of light<br>
There were things<br>
we&rsquo;d never do again<br>
But then they&rsquo;d<br>
always seemed right<br>
There were nights of<br>
endless pleasure<br>
It was more than<br>
all your laws allow<br>
Baby Baby Baby<br>
when you touch me<br>
Like this<br>
and when you hold me<br>
Like that<br>
it was gone<br>
With the wind<br>
but it&rsquo;s all<br>
Coming back to me<br>
when you see me<br>
Like this<br>
and when I see you<br>
Like that<br>
then we see<br>
What we want to see<br>
all coming back to me<br>
The flesh and<br>
the fantasies<br>
All coming back to me<br>
I can barely recall<br>
But it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me now<br>
If you forgive me<br>
all this<br>
If I forgive you<br>
all that<br>
We forgive<br>
and forget<br>
And it&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me now<br>
It&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me now<br>
And when I touch you<br>
like that<br>
It&rsquo;s all<br>
coming back to me now<br>
If you do it<br>
like this<br>
It&rsquo;s all coming back<br>
to me now and if we</p>
