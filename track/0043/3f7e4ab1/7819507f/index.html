    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=61818" target="_black">61818</a></p>
<p>No mountain&rsquo;s too high<br>
for you to climb<br>
All you have to do<br>
is have some climbing<br>
Faith oh yeah<br>
no river&rsquo;s too wide<br>
For you to<br>
make it across<br>
All you have to do<br>
is believe it<br>
When you pray<br>
and then you will see<br>
The morning will come<br>
and everyday<br>
Will be bright<br>
as the sun<br>
All of your fears<br>
cast them on me<br>
I just want<br>
you to see<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your cloud up<br>
in the sky<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your shoulder<br>
when you cry<br>
I&rsquo;ll hear your voices<br>
when you call me<br>
I am your angel<br>
and when all hope<br>
Is gone I&rsquo;m here<br>
no matter how far<br>
You are I&rsquo;m near<br>
It makes<br>
No difference<br>
who you are<br>
I am your angel<br>
I&rsquo;m your angel<br>
I saw your teardrops<br>
and I heard you cry<br>
All you need is time<br>
seek me and<br>
You shall find<br>
you have everything<br>
And you&rsquo;re<br>
still lonely<br>
It don&rsquo;t have<br>
to be this way<br>
Let me show<br>
you a better day<br>
And then you<br>
will see<br>
The morning<br>
will come<br>
And all of your day<br>
will be bright<br>
As the sun<br>
all of your fears<br>
Just cast<br>
Them on me<br>
how can I<br>
make you see<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your cloud up<br>
in the sky<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your shoulder<br>
when you cry<br>
I&rsquo;ll hear your voices<br>
when you call me<br>
I am your angel<br>
And when all hope<br>
Is gone I&rsquo;m here<br>
no matter how far<br>
You are I&rsquo;m near<br>
It makes<br>
No difference<br>
who you are<br>
I am your angel<br>
I&rsquo;m your angel<br>
And when it&rsquo;s time<br>
to face the storm<br>
I&rsquo;ll be there<br>
by your side<br>
This place will keep<br>
us safe and warm<br>
And I know we<br>
will survive<br>
And when it seems as<br>
if your end<br>
Is drawing near<br>
the end is<br>
Drawing near<br>
don&rsquo;t you dare<br>
Give up the fight<br>
just put your trust<br>
Beyond the sky<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your cloud up<br>
In the sky<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your shoulder<br>
When you cry<br>
I&rsquo;ll hear your voices<br>
When you call me<br>
I am your angel<br>
And when all hope<br>
is gone I&rsquo;m here<br>
No matter how far<br>
you are I&rsquo;m near<br>
It makes no difference<br>
who you are<br>
I am your angel<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your cloud up<br>
In the sky<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your shoulder<br>
When you cry<br>
I&rsquo;ll hear your voices<br>
When you call me<br>
I am your angel<br>
And when all hope<br>
is gone I&rsquo;m here<br>
No matter how far<br>
you are I&rsquo;m near<br>
It makes no<br>
difference<br>
Who you are<br>
I am your angel<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your cloud up<br>
in the sky<br>
I&rsquo;ll be your shoulder<br>
when you cry<br>
I&rsquo;ll hear your voices<br>
when you call me<br>
Oh oh uh</p>
