How many brothas fell<br>

Rest in peace<br>
young nigga<br>
There&rsquo;s a heaven<br>
for a G<br>
Be a lie<br>
if I told ya that<br>
I never thought<br>
of death my niggas<br>
We tha last ones left<br>
but life goes on<br>
As I bail through<br>
tha empty halls<br>
Breath stinkin&rsquo;<br>
in my draws<br>
Ring ring ring quiet<br>
y&rsquo;all incoming call<br>
Plus this my homie<br>
from high school<br>
He&rsquo;s getting by<br>
it&rsquo;s time to burry<br>
Another brotha<br>
nobody cry<br>
Life as a baller<br>
alchol and booty calls<br>
We usta do them<br>
as adolecents<br>
Do you recall<br>
raised as G&rsquo;s<br>
Loc&rsquo;ed out and<br>
blazed the weed<br>
Get on tha roof<br>
let&rsquo;s get smoked out<br>
And blaze with me<br>
2 in tha morning<br>
And we still high<br>
assed out<br>
Screamin&rsquo; thug<br>
till I die<br>
Before I passed out<br>
but now that your gone<br>
I&rsquo;m in tha zone<br>
thinkin&rsquo;<br>
I don&rsquo;t wanna die<br>
all alone<br>
But now ya gone<br>
and all I got left<br>
Are stinkin&rsquo; memories<br>
I love them<br>
Niggas to death<br>
I&rsquo;m drinkin&rsquo; hennessy<br>
While tryin&rsquo; ta<br>
make it last<br>
I drink a 5th<br>
for that ass<br>
When you pass<br>
because life goes on<br>
How many brothas fell<br>
victim to tha streetz<br>
Rest in peace<br>
young nigga<br>
There&rsquo;s a heaven<br>
for a G<br>
Be a lie<br>
if I told ya that<br>
I never thought<br>
of death my niggas<br>
We tha last ones left<br>
but life goes on<br>
How many brothas fell<br>
victim to tha streetz<br>
Rest in peace<br>
young nigga<br>
There&rsquo;s a heaven<br>
for a G<br>
Be a lie<br>
if I told ya that<br>
I never thought<br>
of death my niggas<br>
We tha last ones left<br>
and life goes on<br>
Yeah nigga I got<br>
tha word as hell<br>
Ya blew trial<br>
and tha judge gave you<br>
25 with an L<br>
time to prepare<br>
To do fed<br>
time won&rsquo;t see parole<br>
Imagine<br>
life as a convict<br>
That&rsquo;s getten&rsquo; old<br>
plus with tha drama<br>
We&rsquo;re lookin out<br>
for your babies mama<br>
Taken risks while<br>
keepin&rsquo; cheap tricks<br>
From gettin on her<br>
life in tha hood<br>
Is all good for nobody<br>
remember gamin&rsquo;<br>
On dumb hoties<br>
at chill parties<br>
Me and you<br>
no true a two<br>
While scheming on hits<br>
and gettin tricks<br>
That maybe we can<br>
slide into<br>
But now you burried<br>
rest nigga<br>
Because I ain&rsquo;t<br>
worried<br>
Eyes bluried<br>
sayin&rsquo; goodbye<br>
At the cemetery<br>
tho&rsquo; memories fade<br>
I got your name<br>
tated on my arm<br>
So we both ball<br>
till&rsquo; my dying days<br>
Before I say goodbye<br>
kato we&rsquo;re meant<br>
To rest in peace<br>
thug till I die<br>
How many brothas fell<br>
victim to tha streetz<br>
Rest in peace<br>
young nigga<br>
There&rsquo;s a heaven<br>
for a G<br>
Be a lie<br>
if I told ya that<br>
I never thought<br>
of death my niggas<br>
We tha last ones left<br>
and life goes on<br>
How many brothas fell<br>
victim to tha streetz<br>
Rest in peace<br>
young nigga<br>
There&rsquo;s a heaven<br>
for a G<br>
Be a lie<br>
if I told ya that<br>
I never thought<br>
of death my niggas<br>
We tha last ones left<br>
because life goes on<br>
Bury me smilin&rsquo;<br>
with G&rsquo;s in my pocket<br>
Have a party<br>
at my funeral<br>
Let every rapper<br>
rock it<br>
Let tha hoes that<br>
I usta know from way<br>
Before kiss me<br>
from my head to my toe<br>
Give me a paper<br>
and a pen<br>
So I can write<br>
about my life of sin<br>
A couple bottles<br>
of Gin<br>
Incase I don&rsquo;t get in<br>
tell all my people<br>
I&rsquo;m a Ridah<br>
nobody cries<br>
When we die<br>
we outlaws<br>
Let me ride<br>
until I get free<br>
I live my life<br>
in tha fast lane<br>
Got police chasen me<br>
to my niggas<br>
From old blocks<br>
from old crews<br>
Niggas that<br>
guided me through<br>
Back in tha old school<br>
pour out some liquor<br>
Have a toast<br>
for tha homies<br>
See we both<br>
gotta die<br>
But ya chose to go<br>
before me<br>
And brothas miss ya<br>
while you&rsquo;re gone<br>
You left your nigga<br>
on his own<br>
How long we mourn<br>
life goes on<br>
How many brothas fell<br>
victim to tha streetz<br>
Rest in peace<br>
young nigga<br>
There&rsquo;s a heaven<br>
for a G<br>
Be a lie<br>
if I told ya that<br>
I never thought<br>
of death my niggas<br>
We tha last ones left<br>
life goes on<br>
How many brothas fell<br>
victim to tha streetz<br>
Rest in peace<br>
young nigga<br>
There&rsquo;s a heaven<br>
for a G<br>
Be a lie<br>
if I told ya that<br>
I never thought<br>
of death my niggas<br>
We tha last ones left<br>
but life goes on<br>
How many brothas fell<br>
victim to tha streetz<br>
Rest in peace<br>
young nigga<br>
There&rsquo;s a heaven<br>
for a G<br>
