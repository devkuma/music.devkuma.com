<p>Come on come on<br>
I see no changes<br>
Wake up in the morning<br>
and I ask myself<br>
Is life worth living<br>
should I blast myself?<br>
I&rsquo;m tired of<br>
bein&rsquo; poor<br>
&amp; even worse I&rsquo;m black<br>
my stomach hurts<br>
So I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; for<br>
a purse to snatch<br>
Cops give a damn<br>
about a negro<br>
Pull the trigger<br>
kill a nigga<br>
He&rsquo;s a hero<br>
give the crack<br>
To the kids<br>
who the hell cares<br>
One less hungry mouth<br>
on the welfare<br>
First ship &rsquo;em dope<br>
&amp; let &rsquo;em<br>
Deal the brothers<br>
give &rsquo;em guns<br>
Step back watch &rsquo;em<br>
kill each other<br>
It&rsquo;s time<br>
to fight back<br>
That&rsquo;s what Huey said<br>
2 shots<br>
In the dark now<br>
Huey&rsquo;s dead<br>
I got love<br>
for my brother<br>
But we can never<br>
go nowhere<br>
Unless we share<br>
with each other<br>
We gotta start<br>
makin&rsquo; changes<br>
Learn to see me<br>
as a brother<br>
Instead of<br>
2 distant strangers<br>
And that&rsquo;s how<br>
it&rsquo;s supposed to be<br>
How can the Devil<br>
take a brother<br>
If he&rsquo;s close<br>
to me? uh<br>
I&rsquo;d love to go back to<br>
when we played as kids<br>
But things changed<br>
and that&rsquo;s<br>
The way it is<br>
come on come on<br>
That&rsquo;s just<br>
the way it is<br>
Things&rsquo;ll never<br>
be the same<br>
That&rsquo;s just the way<br>
it is oh yeah<br>
That&rsquo;s just<br>
the way it is<br>
Things&rsquo;ll never<br>
be the same<br>
That&rsquo;s just the way<br>
it is oh yeah<br>
Come on<br>
I see no changes<br>
All I see is<br>
racist faces<br>
Misplaced hate makes<br>
disgrace to races<br>
We under I wonder what<br>
it takes to make this<br>
One better place<br>
let&rsquo;s erase the wasted<br>
Take the evil<br>
out the people<br>
They&rsquo;ll be<br>
acting right<br>
&lsquo;Cause both<br>
black and white<br>
Is smokin&rsquo; crack<br>
tonight<br>
And only time<br>
we chill is<br>
When we kill<br>
each other<br>
It takes skill<br>
to be real<br>
Time to heal<br>
each other<br>
And although it seems<br>
heaven sent<br>
We ain&rsquo;t ready to see<br>
a black President uh<br>
It ain&rsquo;t a secret<br>
don&rsquo;t conceal the fact<br>
The penitentiary&rsquo;s<br>
packed<br>
And it&rsquo;s filled<br>
with blacks<br>
But some things<br>
will never change<br>
Try to show<br>
another way<br>
But you stayin&rsquo;<br>
in the dope game<br>
Now tell me<br>
what&rsquo;s a mother to do<br>
Bein&rsquo; real<br>
don&rsquo;t appeal<br>
To the brother<br>
in you yeah<br>
You gotta operate<br>
the easy way<br>
&ldquo;I made a G today&rdquo;<br>
but you made it<br>
In a sleazy way<br>
sellin&rsquo; crack<br>
To the kid<br>
&ldquo;I gotta get paid&rdquo;<br>
Well that&rsquo;s the way<br>
it is come on come on<br>
That&rsquo;s just<br>
the way it is<br>
Things&rsquo;ll never<br>
be the same<br>
That&rsquo;s just the way<br>
it is oh yeah<br>
That&rsquo;s just<br>
the way it is<br>
Things&rsquo;ll never<br>
be the same<br>
That&rsquo;s just the way<br>
it is oh yeah<br>
We gotta make a change<br>
it&rsquo;s time for us<br>
As a people to start<br>
makin&rsquo; some changes<br>
Let&rsquo;s change<br>
the way we eat<br>
Let&rsquo;s change<br>
the way we live<br>
And let&rsquo;s change<br>
the way we treat<br>
Each other<br>
you see the old way<br>
Wasn&rsquo;t working<br>
so it&rsquo;s on us to do<br>
What we gotta do<br>
to survive<br>
And still I see<br>
no changes<br>
Can&rsquo;t brother<br>
get a little peace<br>
It&rsquo;s war<br>
on the streets<br>
&amp; the war<br>
in the Middle East<br>
Instead of war<br>
on poverty<br>
They got a war<br>
on drugs<br>
So the police<br>
can bother me<br>
And I ain&rsquo;t<br>
never did a crime<br>
I ain&rsquo;t have to do<br>
but now I&rsquo;m back<br>
With the blacks<br>
givin&rsquo; it back to you<br>
Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em<br>
jack you up<br>
Back you up<br>
crack you up<br>
And pimp slap you up<br>
you gotta learn<br>
To hold ya own<br>
they get jealous<br>
When they see ya<br>
with ya mobile phone<br>
But tell the cops<br>
they can&rsquo;t touch this<br>
I don&rsquo;t trust this<br>
when they try to rush<br>
I bust this<br>
that&rsquo;s the sound<br>
Of my tool<br>
you say it ain&rsquo;t cool<br>
My mama didn&rsquo;t<br>
raise no fool<br>
And as long as<br>
I stay black<br>
I gotta stay strapped<br>
&amp; I never get<br>
To lay back<br>
&lsquo;cause I always<br>
Got to worry<br>
&lsquo;bout the pay backs<br>
Some buck that<br>
I roughed up way back<br>
Comin&rsquo; back<br>
after all these years<br>
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat<br>
that&rsquo;s the way it is<br>
Uh that&rsquo;s just<br>
the way it is<br>
Things&rsquo;ll never<br>
be the same<br>
That&rsquo;s just the way<br>
it is oh yeah<br>
That&rsquo;s just<br>
the way it is<br>
Things&rsquo;ll never<br>
be the same<br>
That&rsquo;s just the way<br>
it is oh yeah<br>
Some things will<br>
never change</p>
