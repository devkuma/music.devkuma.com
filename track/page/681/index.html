                If you search for tenderness It isnt hard to find You can have the love you need to live But if you look for truthfulness You might just as well be blind It always seems to be so hard to give Honesty is such a lonely word Everyone is so untrue Honesty is hardly ever heard And mostly what I need from you I can always find someone To say they sympathize If I wear my heart out on my sleeve But I dont want some pretty face To tell me pretty lies All I want is someone to believe Honesty is such a lonely word Everyone is so untrue Honesty is hardly ever heard And mostly what I need from you I can find a lover I can find a friend I can have security until the bitter end Anyone can comfort me with promises again I know I know I know wo wo When Im deep inside of me Dont be too concerned I wont ask for nothing While Im gone But when I want sincerity Tell me where else can I turn Cause youre the one that I depend upon Honesty is such a lonely word Everyone is so untrue Honesty is hardly ever heard And mostly what I need from you

                Isnt it rich are we a pair Me here at last on the ground You in midair send in the clowns Isnt it bliss dont you approve One who keeps tearing around One who cant move Where are the clowns send in the clowns Just when Id stopped opening doors Finally knowing the one That I wanted was yours Making my entrance again With my usual flair Sure of my lines no one is there Dont you love a farce my fault I fear I thought that youd want What I want sorry my dear But where are the clowns There ought to be clowns Quick send in the clowns What a surprise who could foresee Id come to feel about you What you felt about me Why only now when I see That youve drifted away What a surprise what a cliche Isnt it rich isnt it queer Losing my timing this late in my career And where are the clowns Quick send in the clowns Dont bother theyre here
