                Days go so slowly by I find myself all left alone without you Did it have to come this far youre Somewhere I just cant reach 너를 다시 볼 수만 있다면 나의 사랑을 말하고 싶었어 자신없던 내 모습에 너의 사랑을 피할 수 밖에 없었던 내 마음을 하지만 너를 우연히 만났을때 너의 아픈 그 미소가 너에게 하려던 말을 할 수 없게 했었어 Our last memory maybe inside my heart Its time for me to tell you The time we had with each other Will never come back to us again 널 기다렸던 그 시간들보다 널 볼 수 없다는 그 긴시간들이 나를 더욱 더 힘들게 하겠지 하지만 이제는 널 떠나보낼 수 있어 이렇게 너를 보내지만 영원히 내 맘안에 너와의 시간을 추억하겠지 나만큼은 아니더라도 가끔씩 외로움에 지쳐서 슬퍼질때면 나를 떠올리길 바랄께 I guess thats what I must take in Now everything seems All so fair maybe tomorrow Is when Ill need you until then
