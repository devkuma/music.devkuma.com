                Tonight the sky above reminds me of you love Walking through wintertime Where the stars all shine The angel on the stairs Will tell you I was there Under the front porch light On a mystery night Ive been sitting watching life pass From the sidelines been waiting For a dream to seep in through my blinds I wondered what might happen If I left this all behind Would the wind be at my back Could I get you Off my mind this time  The neon lights in bars And headlights from the cars Have started a symphony Surrounding me the things I left behind have melted In my mind and now Theres a purity inside of me Ive been sitting watching life pass From the sidelines been waiting For a dream to seep in through my blinds I wondered what might happen If I left this all behind Would the wind be at my back Could I get you Off my mind this time  Ive been sitting watching life pass From the sidelines been waiting For a dream to seep in through my blinds I wondered what might happen If I left this all behind Would the wind be at my back Could I get you Off my mind this time
