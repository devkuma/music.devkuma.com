                I think about that day I left him at a Greyhound station West of Santa Fe we were seventeen But he was sweet and it was true Still I did what I had to do Cause I just knew summer Sunday nights Wed sink into our seats Right as they dimmed out all the lights A technicolor world Made out of music and machine It called me to be on that screen And live inside each scene Without a nickel to my name Hopped a bus here I came Could be brave or just insane Well have to see Cause maybe in that sleepy town Hell sit one day the lights are down Hell see my face and think of how he Used to know me Climb these hills Im reaching for the heights And chasing all the lights that shine And when they let you down Youll get up off the ground Cause morning rolls around And its another day of sun I hear em every day The rhythms in the canyons Thatll never fade away The ballads in the barrooms Left by those who came before They say you gotta want it more So I bang on every door And even when the answers no Or when my moneys running low The dusty mic and neon glow Are all I need And someday as I sing my song A smalltown kidll come along Thatll be the thing To push him on and go go Climb these hills Im reaching for the heights And chasing all the lights that shine And when they let you down Youll get up off the ground Cause morning rolls around And its another day of sun  When they let you down The morning rolls around Its another day of sun Its another day of sun Its another day of sun Its another day of sun Its another day of sun Its another day of sun The day has just begun Its another day of sun Its another day of sun
