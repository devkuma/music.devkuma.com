                I dont have much to give But I dont care for gold What use is money When you need someone to hold Dont have direction Im just rolling down this road Waiting for you to bring me In from out the cold Youll never know the endless nights The rhyming of the rain Or how it feels to fall behind And watch you call his name Pack up and leave everything Dont you see what I can bring Cant keep this beating heart at bay Set my midnight sorrow free I will give you all of me Just leave your lover leave him for me Leave your lover leave him for me  We sit in bars and raise Our drinks to growing old Oh Im in love with you And you will never know But if I cant have you I want this life alone Spare you the rising storms And let the rivers flow Youll never know the endless nights The rhyming of the rain Or how it feels to fall behind And watch you call his name Pack up and leave everything Dont you see what I can bring Cant keep this beating heart at bay Set my midnight sorrow free I will give you all of me Just leave your lover leave him for me Leave your lover leave him for me Leave your lover leave him for me
