                Snow is falling from the sky In the middle of July sun was shining In my eyes again last night Alarm goes off without a sound The silence is so loud something isnt right Footstep echo down the hall No ones there at all dial your number But your voice says Im not home Everything is inside out I dont know what its about It keeps getting stranger by the day Stranger by the day it keeps getting Stranger by the day stranger by the day Going for a walk outside To see what I can find No reflections in the windows I pass by it feels hotter In the shade water runs up From the drain somethings going on Conversations with a mime Stared at by the blind Imaginations must be working overtime The world is upside down Everything is turned around It keeps getting stranger by the day Stranger by the day it keeps getting Stranger by the day stranger by the day  By the time I reach your door I cant take anymore I just happened to be in your neighborhood Im the one who gets surprised I dont believe my eyes Your alibis no good Whatever happened to the world Whatever happened to the girl I thought I knew it just cant be true I guess Im losing you Stranger by the day stranger by the day It keeps getting stranger by the day Stranger by the day stranger by the day Stranger by the day stranger by the day
