                A long long time ago I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew that if I had my chance I could make those people dance And maybe theyd be happy for a while  Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the bible tells you so Now do you believe in RockN Roll And can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow Well I know that youre in love With him cause I saw You dancin in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man I did those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage bronc in buck With a pink carnation and a pick up truck But I knew that I was out of luck the day The music died I started singin Bye bye Miss American pie Drove my chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good ole boys were drinkin Whiskey and rye singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away Then I went down to this sacred store Where I heard the music years before But the man there said the music Wouldnt play well now In the streets the children screamed The lovers cry and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admired the most The father son and the holy ghost They caught the last train For the coast the day The music died we started singin Bye bye Miss American pie Drove my chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good ole boys were drinkin Whiskey and rye singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die  Bye bye Miss American pie Drove my chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good ole boys were drinkin Whiskey and rye singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die We started singin we started singin We started singin we started singin

                Youll take my life But Ill take yours too Youll fire your musket But Ill run you through So when youre waiting for the next attack Youd better stand Theres no turning back The bugle sounds and the charge begins But on this battlefield No one wins the smell of Acrid smoke and horses breath As I plunge on into certain death oh oh  The horse he sweats with fear We break to run The mighty roar of the Russian guns And as we race towards the human wall The screams of pain as my comrades fall We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground And the Russians fire another round We get so near yet so far away We wont live to fight another day oh oh  We get so close near enough to fight When a Russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow A burst of rounds take my horse below And as I lay there gazing at the sky My bodys numb and my throat is dry And as I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear I draw My parting groan oh oh
