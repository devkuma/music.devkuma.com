                Woo feeling rockqueers Were ready to kick tonight No hesitating my bodys aching Looking for some action Satisfaction all right charging vain grace As active as the hundreds size Of proof megation reliving On were ready to hit the room You better watch out and hold on tight Were heading your way like a dynamite Delivering the goods delivering the goods Shake down rock them boys Crack that whip Strap mean pulse rave Airwaves Find a rather newer Places down stealing your hearts All across the land hot blood doing good Were gonna load it with our friend You better watch out and hold on tight Were heading your way like a dynamite Delivering the goods delivering the goods  Hey your way stay your way Oh its all gonna punches we aim With the crunches laugh until we send it To your brain if we look Before we fell we knock But more than yell gonna do it Again and again well beat you Into submission so you might as Well surrender do come over and Listen just the angle by youre hearing The picture bust up ah til the seams that Were gonna break shoot further Giving more than Youre ever gonna take Leading your heads Crushed down On the floor Begging for Mercy be careful or Ill do it some more You better watch out and hold on tight Were hedding your way like a dynamite Delivering the goods delivering the goods

                As the sun goes down I move around Keeping to the shadow life hangs By a thread and Ive heard it said That Ill not see tomorrow If thats my destiny itll have to be So Ill face the future Running out of time Im on the line But Ill go down fighting  Felt the hand of justice Telling wrong from right Threw me out upon the street In the middle of the night Cybernetic heartbeat digital precise Pneumatic fingers nearly had me In their vice not begging you Im telling you you wont break me You wont make me you wont take me Under blood red skies you wont break me You wont take me Ill fight you Under blood red skies through A shattered city watched by laser eyes Overhead the night squad glides The decaying paradise automatic sniper With computer sights scans The bleak horizon for its victim Of the night theyre closing in Theyll never win you wont break me You wont take me you wont make me Under blood red skies you wont break me You wont take me Ill fight you Under blood red skies as the end is Drawing near standing proud I wont give in to fear as I die A legend will be born I will stand I will fight youll never take me alive  Ill stand my ground I wont go down You wont break me you wont take me Just Ill fight you under blood red skies You wont break me you wont take me Just Ill fight you under blood red skies Youll never take me alive Im telling you hands of justice I will stand I will fight As the sun goes down
