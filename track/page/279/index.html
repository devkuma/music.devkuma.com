                This song is dedicated to our neighbors 다시 귀기울여 들어요 저 그늘진 곳에서 들려오는 한숨소리 고된 하루하루가 힘겨워 내일이 오는 것도 두렵기만 한 거겠죠 어두운 세상에 버려진 듯이 혼자라고 느끼지 않도록 살을 에는 시린 바람도 함께 막아줄게요 오직 사랑 하나죠 내가 가진 건 너무도 작고 작지만 함께 나누면 기적과 같은 일이 일어나죠 우리 사랑뿐이죠 어두워진 얼굴에 해맑은 미소를 찾아주는 건 우리 작은 사랑의 큰 힘이죠 먼저 손잡아주세요 아직 어린 두 눈에 눈물은 안되죠 여린 어깨 위를 짓누르는 그 무거운 현실에 아이다운 꿈마저 잃어가죠 어두운 세상에 버려진 듯이 혼자라고 느끼지 않도록 살을 에는 시린 바람도 함께 막아줄게요 오직 사랑 하나죠 내가 가진 건 너무도 작고 작지만 함께 나누면 기적과 같은 일이 일어나죠 우리 사랑뿐이죠 어두워진 얼굴에 해맑은 미소를 찾아주는 건 우리 작은 사랑의 큰 힘이죠 워 우워 모른 척 지나치지 말아요 그대 손길을 기다려요 밝은 빛이 되어줄 사랑을 함께 나누어가요 거칠어져 버렸네 이 세상이 모두 막막해 숨을 쉬고 싶어 해 나의 그대 이제 혼자라 느끼지 않게 해줄게 So I pray God Every single moment 채워지지 않는 emptiness 악한 영혼들이 우릴 향해 손을 뻗어 Please hold your hand and Everybody will be happy 오직 사랑 하나죠 사랑 하나로 우리 살아갈 이곳은 힘이 들어도 아직까지는 아름다운 세상 우리 사랑뿐이죠 견뎌내기 어려운 시련을 만나도 손 내밀어 줄 그대 있어 따뜻한 세상이 될 거예요

                Every dream that I dream Seems to float on by like a cloud In the wind way up in the sky Every move that I makes Seems to be the wrong way Like a cold black night After a summer day what can I do What can I do nothing to say But it used to be nothing to say But it used to be what can I do You still play my guitar With a smile on my face Now everythings changed My whole lifes rearranged From the day I was born Sidle jinks was my name Though I tried and I tried That name still remains What can I do what can I do Nothing to say but it used to be Nothing to say but it used to be What can I do  What can I do what can I do What can I do what can I do I hear voices all singing But no one is there its a ghost Of my life bringing past tense to mind Lockin key inside me from the freedom And sin oh come let me in Ill start all over again What can I do what can I do Nothing to say but it used to be No no no no no no no no no what can I do  What can I do what can I do what

                Shes faced the hardest times You could imagine and many times Her eyes fought back the tears And when her youthful world Was about to fail in each time Her slender shoulders wore the weight Of all her fears and a sorrow No one hears still rings In midnight silence in her ears Let her cry for shes a lady Let her dream for shes a child Let the rain fall down upon her Shes a free and gentle flower Growing wild and if by chance I should hold her let me hold her For a time but if allowed Just one possession I would pick her From the garden to be mine  Mm be careful how you touch her For shell awaken and sleeps The only freedom that she knows And when you look into her eyes You wont believe the way shes always Paying for a dept she never owed And a silent wind still blows That only she can hear and so she goes Let her cry for shes a lady Let her dream for shes a child Let the rain fall down upon her Shes a free and gentle flower Growing wild Let her cry for shes a lady Let her dream for shes a child Let the rain fall down upon her Shes a free and gentle flower Growing wild Shes a flower growing wild
