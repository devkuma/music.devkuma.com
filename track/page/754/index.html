                He comes from a foreign place An island far away Intrigues me with every move Till Im breathless Im helpless Cant keep my cool Steals my heart when he takes my hand And we dance to the rhythm of the band I feel his fingertips grip my hips And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss Mama used to warn me to beware those Latin lovers she said I gave my heart too Soon and thats how I became your mother I said ay mama you seem to forget Im not in love yet Sweet talks dont win me over But I realized big brown eyes Can hypnotize when he says I am full blood boricua Read the tattoo on his arm He tells me mami I need ya And my heart beat pumps so strong Getting lost in el ritmo He whispers te quiero te quiero I begin to give in with no hesitation Cant help my infatuation Its pure Infatuation Skin the color of cinnamon His eyes light up and I melt within Feels so good it must be a sin I cant stop what I started Im givin in He brings life to my fantasies Sparks a passion inside of me Finds the words when I cannot speak In the silence his heart Beat is music to me mama used to warn me Not to rush love with another She said Im not trying to lecture I just care about my daughter Ay mama you seem to forget I never will let a man control my emotions But when he smiles I feel like A little child and when he says I am full blood boricua Read the tattoo on his arm He tells me mami I need ya And my heart beat pumps so strong Getting lost in el ritmo He whispers te quiero te quiero I begin to give in with no hesitation Cant help my infatuation Its pure infatuation Caught between my mamas words And what I feel inside Wanted to explore his world But part of me wants to hide Should I risk it cant resist it This has caught me by surprise Should I let him take me to Puerto Rico I cant hold back no more lets go tonight Papi hold me say that you adore me Never let go never leave me lonely Papi hold me say that you adore me Never let go never leave me lonely I am full blood boricua Read the tattoo on his arm He tells me mami I need ya And my heart beat pumps so strong Getting lost in el ritmo He whispers te quiero te quiero I begin to give in with no hesitation Cant help my infatuation Its pure infatuation Cant help my infatuation Its pure infatuation Hey yeah
