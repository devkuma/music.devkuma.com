                Psychic spies from China Try to steal your mind elation And little girls from Sweden Dream of silver screen partation And if you want these kind of dreams Its californication  Its the edge of the world And all of western civilization The sun may rise in the east At least it settled in a final location Its understood that Hollywood Sells californication  Pay your surgeon very well To break the spell of aging Celebrity skin is this your gender Or is that war your waging First born unicorn hard core soft porn Dream of californication Dream of californication  Marry me girl be my fairy to my world Be my very own constellation A teenage bride with a baby inside Getting high on information And buy me a star on the boulevard Its californication  Space may be the final frontier But its made in a Hollywood basement And cobain can you hear the spheres Singing songs off station to station And Alderaans not far away Its californication  Born and raised by those who praise Control of population everybodys been there And I dont mean on vacation First born unicorn hard core soft porn Dream of californication Dream of californication Dream of californication Dream of californication  Destruction leads to a very rough road But it also breeds creation And earthquakes are to a girls guitar They are just another good vibration And tidal waves couldnt save The world from californication  Pay your surgeon very well To break the spell of aging Sicker then the rest there is no test But this is what youre craving First born unicorn hard core soft porn Dream of californication Dream of californication Dream of californication Dream of californication
