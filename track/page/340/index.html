                Again youre gone Off on a different path than mine Im left behind Wondering if I should follow You had to go And of course its always fine I probably could catch up With you tomorrow But is this what it feels like To be growing apart When did I become the one Whos always chasing your heart Now I turn around and find I am lost in the woods North is south right is left When youre gone Im the one who sees you home But now Im lost in the woods And I dont know what path you are on Im lost in the woods Up til now The next step was a question of how I never thought it was a question of whether Who am I if Im not your guy Where am I if were not together forever Now I know youre my true north Cause I am lost in the woods Up is down day is night When youre not there Oh youre my only landmark So Im lost in the woods Wondering if you still care But Ill wait for a signfor a sign That Im your path Cause you are mine you are mine Until then Im lost in the woods Lost in the woods lost in the woods Lost in the woods Im lost in the woods Lost in the woods lost lost lost Im lost in the woods
