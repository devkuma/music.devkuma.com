                Everybodys looking for that something One thing that makes it all complete You find it in the strangest places Places you never thought it could be Some find it in the faces Of their children Some find it in their lovers eyes Who can deny the joy it brings When you find that special thing Youre flying without wings Some find it sharing every morning Some in their solitary lives You find it in the words of others A simple line can make you Laugh or cry You find it in the deepest friendships The kind you cherish all your life And when you know how much that means Youve found that special thing Youre flying without wings So impossible as it may seem Youve got to fight for every dream Cause whos to know Which one you let go Would have made you complete Well for me its waking up beside you To watch the sunrise on your face To know that I can say I love you At any given time or place Its little the things that only I know Those are the things that make you mine And its like flying without wings Cause youre my special thing Im flying without wings Youre the place my life begins And youll be where it ends Im flying without wings And thats the joy you bring Im flying without wings
