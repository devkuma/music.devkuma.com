                Slip inside the eye of your mind Dont you know you might find A better place to play You said that youd never been But all the things that youve seen Will slowly fade away So I start the revolution From my bed Cause you said the brains I have went to my head Step outside the summertimes in bloom Stand up beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face You aint ever gonna burn my heart out And so Sally can wait She knows its too late As were walking on by Her soul slides away But dont look back in anger I heard you say  Take me to the place where you go Where nobody knows If its night or day Please dont put your life in the hands Of a Rock n Roll band Wholl throw it all away Im gonna start the revolution From my bed Cause you said the brains I have went to my head Step outside the summertimes in bloom Stand up beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face Cause you aint ever Gonna burn my heart out And so Sally can wait She knows its too late As shes walking on by My soul slides away But dont look back in anger I heard you say  So Sally can wait She knows its too late As were walking on by Her soul slides away But dont look back in anger I heard you say So Sally can wait She knows its too late As shes walking on by My soul slides away But dont look back in anger Dont look back in anger I heard you say At least not today
