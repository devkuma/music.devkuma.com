                Lying beside you hear in the dark Feeling your heartbeat with mine softly You whisper youre so sincere How could our love be so blind We sailed on together we drifted a part And here you are by my side So now I come to you with open arms Nothing to hide believe what I say So here I am with open arms Hoping you see what you love means To me open arms  Living without you living alone This empty house seems so cold Wanting to hold you wanting you near How much I wanted you home But now that youve come back Turned night into day I need you to stay So now I come to you with open arms Nothing to hide believe what I say So here I am with open arms Hoping you see what your love means To me open arms
