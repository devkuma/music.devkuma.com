                How can I just let you walk away Just let you leave without a trace When I stand here taking Every breath with you woo Youre the only one Who really knew me at all How can you just walk away from me When all I can do is watch you leave Cause you share the laughter And the pain and even shared The tears youre the only one Who really knew me at all So take a look at me now Theres just an empty space Theres nothing left here To remind me just the memory Of your face well take a look at me now Theres just an empty space You comin back to me is against the odds And thats what lve got to face I wish I could just make you turn around Turn around to see me cry Theres so much I need to say to you So many reasons why youre the only one Who really knew me at all So take a look at me now Theres just an empty space Theres nothing left here to remind me Just the memory of your face Now take a look at me now Cause theres just an empty space But to wait for you is all I can do And thats what Ive got to face Take a good look at me now Cause Ill still be standing here And you comin back to me Is against the odds Its the chance Ive gotta take Take a look at me now
