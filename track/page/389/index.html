                Goodbye to you my trusted friend Weve known each other Since we were nine or ten Together we climbed hills and trees Learned of love and ABCs Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees Goodbye my friend its hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Pretty girls are everywhere Think of me and Ill be there We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the hills that we climbed Were just seasons out of time Goodbye Papa please pray for me I was the black sheep of the family You tried to teach me right from wrong Too much wine and too much song Wonder how I got along Goodbye Papa its hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air Little children everywhere When you see them Ill be there We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons have all gone yeah Goodbye Michelle my little one You gave me love and helped me find the sun And every time when I was down You would always come around And get my feet back on the ground Goodbye Michelle its hard to die When all the birds are singing in the sky Now that the spring is in the air With the flowers everywhere I wish that we could both be there We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the hills that we climbed Were just seasons out of time We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons have all gone We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons have all gone We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons have all gone We had joy we had fun We had seasons in the sun But the wine and the song Like the seasons have all gone

                I am sitting in the morning At the diner on the corner I am waiting at the counter For the man to pour the coffee And he fills it only halfway And before I even argue He is looking out the window At somebody coming in  It is always nice to see you Says the man behind the counter To the woman who has come in She is shaking her umbrella And I look the other way As they are kissing their hellos Im pretending not to see them Instead I pour the milk  I open up the paper Theres a story of an actor Who had died while he was drinking It was no one I had heard of And Im turning to the horoscope And looking for the funnies When Im feeling someone watching me And so I raise my head  Theres woman on the outside Looking inside does she see me No she does not really see me Cause she sees her own reflection And Im trying not to notice That shes hitching up her skirt And while shes straightening Her stockings her hair is getting wet  Oh this rain it will continue Thought the morning as Im listening To the bells of the cathedral I am thinking of your voice
