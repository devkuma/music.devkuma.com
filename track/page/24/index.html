                Im so glad you made time to see me Hows life tell me hows your family I havent seen them in a while Youve been good busier than ever  We small talk work and the weather Your guard is up and I know why Because the last time you saw me It still burned in the back of your mind You gave me roses and I left them there to die  So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you Saying Im sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time  It turns out freedom mean nothing but missing you Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December turn around and make it all right I go back to December all the time  These days I havent been sleeping Staying up playing back myself leaving When you birthday passed And I didnt call  Then I think about summer all the beautiful times I watched you laughing From the passenger side And I realized I loved you in the fall  And then the cold came the dark days When fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love And all I gave you was goodbye  So this is me swallowing my pride  Standing in front of you Saying Im sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time  It turns out freedom mean nothing but missing you Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time  I miss your tan skin your sweet smile So good to me so right And how you held me in your arms That September night  The first time you ever saw me cry Baby this is wishful thinking Probably mindless dreaming If we loved again I swear Id love you right  Id go back in time and change it but I cant So if the chain is on your door I understand  But this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you Saying Im sorry for that night And I go back to December  It turns out freedom mean nothing but missing you Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December turn around and make it all right I go back to December turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time  All the time  Back To December Taylor Swift

                One night a few moons ago I saw flecks of what couldve been lights But it might just have been you Passing by unbeknownst to me Life is emotionally abusive And time cant stop me quite like you did And my flight was awful thanks for asking Im unglued thanks to you And its like snow at the beach Weird but fucking beautiful Flying in a dream Stars by the pocketful You wanting me Tonight feels impossible But its coming down No sound its all around Like snow on the beach Like snow on the beach Like snow on the beach Like snow ah This scene feels like What I once saw on a screen I searched aurora borealis green Ive never seen someone lit from within Blurring out my periphery My smile is like I won a contest And to hide that would be so dishonest And its fine to fake it til you make it Til you do til its true Now its like snow at the beach Weird but fucking beautiful Flying in a dream Stars by the pocketful You wanting me Tonight feels impossible But its coming down No sound its all around Like snow on the beach Like snow on the beach Like snow on the beach Like snow ah I cant speak afraid to jinx it I dont even dare to wish it But your eyes are flying saucers From another planet Now Im all for you like Janet Can this be a real thing Can it Are we falling like snow at the beach Snow at the beach Weird but fucking beautiful Flying in a dreamFlying in a dream Stars by the pocketful You wanting meYou wanting me Tonight feels impossible But its coming down No sound its all around Like snow on the beachSnow on the beach Like snow on the beachSnow on the beach Like snow on the beachSnow on the beach Like snow ah Its coming down No sound its all around Like snow on the beach Its coming down its coming down Its coming down its coming down Like snow on the beach Its coming down its coming down Its coming down its coming down Its coming down its coming down Its coming down its coming down Its coming down its coming down Its coming down its coming down

                When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old You ask for the tab Or that moment again hes insisting that friends Look at each other like that When the words of a sister come back in whispers That prove she was not in fact what she seemed Not a twin from your dreams Shes a crook who was caught  That old familiar body ache The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul You know when its time to go  Twenty years at your job Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours Or trying to stay for the kids When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse  That old familiar body ache The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul You know when its time to go  Sometimes giving up is the strong thing Sometimes to run is the brave thing Sometimes walking out is the one thing That will find you the right thing Sometimes giving up is the strong thing Sometimes to run is the brave thing Sometimes walking out is the one thing That will find you the right thing  Fifteen years fifteen million tears Begging til my knees bled I gave it my all he gave me nothing at all Then wondered why I left Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones Praying to his greed Hes got my past frozen behind glass But Ive got me  That old familiar body ache The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul I know when its time to go  Sometimes giving up is the strong thing Sometimes to run is the brave thing Sometimes walking out is the one thing That will find you the right thing Sometimes giving up is the strong thing Sometimes to run is the brave thing Sometimes walking out is the one thing That will find you the right thing  That will find you the right thing And you know in your soul And you know in your soul When its time to go You know you know you know you know When its time to go So then you go Then you go You just go
