                Life it seems will fade away Drifting further every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters no one else I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free  Things are not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly lost this cant be real Cant stand this hell I feel Emptiness is filing me To the point of agony Growing darkness taking dawn I was he but now hes gone  No one but me can save myself But it to late now I can think Think why I should even try  Yesterday seems as though It never existed death greets me warm Now I will just say goodbye
