                On the first page of our story The future seemed so bright Then this thing turned out so evil I dont know why Im still surprised Even angels have their wicked schemes And you take that to new extremes But youll always be my hero Even though youve lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But thats all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But thats all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie oh I love the way you lie Now theres gravel in our voices Glass is shattered from the fight In this tug of war youll always win Even when Im right Cause you feed me fables from your hand With violent words and empty threats And its sick That all these battles are What keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But thats all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But thats all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie oh I love the way you lie oh So maybe Im a masochist I try to run But I dont wanna ever leave Til the walls are going up In smoke with all our memories This morning you wake A sunray hits your face Smeared makeup as we lay In the wake of destruction Hush baby speak softly tell me Ill be sorry That you pushed me Into the coffee table last night So I can push you off me Try and touch me so I can scream At you not to touch me Run out the room And Ill follow you like a lost puppy Baby without you Im nothing Im so lost hug me Then tell me how ugly I am But that youll always love me Then after that shove me In the aftermath of the destructive path That were on two psychopaths But we know that no matter How many knives we put in each others backs That well have each others backs Cause were that lucky together We move mountains Lets not make mountains Out of molehills You hit me twice yeah but whos counting I may have hit you three times Im starting to lose count But together well live forever We found the youth fountain Our love is crazy were nuts But I refused counseling This house is too huge If you move out Ill burn All two thousand square feet Of it to the ground Aint shit you can do about it is With you Im in my xucking mind Without you Im out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But thats all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But thats all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
