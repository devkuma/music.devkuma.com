                Of all the things I believed in I just want to get it over with Tears form behind my eyes But I do not cry Counting the days that pass me by Ive been searching deep down in my soul Words that Im hearing Are starting to get old It feels like Im starting All over again The last three years were Just pretend and I said Goodbye to you goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to I still get lost in your eyes And it seems that I cant live a day Without you closing my eyes And you chase my thoughts away To a place where I am blinded By the light but its not right Goodbye to you goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to  And it hurts to want everything And nothing at the same time I want whats yours and I want whats mine I want you but Im not giving in this time Goodbye to you goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to Goodbye to you goodbye to everything I thought I knew You were the one I loved The one thing that I tried to hold on to The one thing that I tried to hold on to The one thing that I tried to hold on to And when the stars fall I will lie awake Youre my shooting star
