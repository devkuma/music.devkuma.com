                Lying alone touching my skin Im falling under A girl like me and I cant hold it in It makes me wonder Is this for real Its not what it seems youre like an angel Im running now My feet off the ground oh Take me touch me Wont you hold me close And then we kiss Your love comes alive on my lips I feel a rush Coming over me over me And when we touch This moment when everythings still I close my eyes and then we kiss The feel of your hand as it touches my hair It makes me tremble Dont wanna let go Of the feelings we share So baby go slow Our hearts beating fast And my body cries yeah I want it to last its burning inside Were getting deeper Take me touch me Wont you hold me close And then we kiss Your love comes alive on my lips I feel a rush Coming over me over me And when we touch This moment when everythings still I close my eyes and then we kiss Youre drifting the sun comes up Youre fading you seem so far I dont know if Im awake Open my eyes and then we kiss Take me touch me Wont you hold me close And then we kiss Your love comes alive on my lips I feel a rush Coming over me over me And when we touch This moment when everythings still I close my eyes and then we kiss And then we kiss and then we kiss And when we touch This moment when everythings still I close my eyes and then we kiss
