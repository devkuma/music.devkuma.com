                On a cobweb afternoon in a Room full of emptiness By a freeway I confess I was lost in the pages of a book Full of death Reading how well Die alone And if were good Well lay to rest Anywhere we Want to go In your house I long to be Room by room Patiently Ill wait for you there Like a stone Ill Wait for you there Alone  And on my deathbed I will pray To the gods and the angels Like a pagan to anyone Who will take me to heaven To a place I recall I was there so Long ago The sky was bruised The wine was bled And there you led me on In your house I long to be Room by room patiently Ill wait for you there Like a stone Ill wait for you there Alone Alone  And on I read Until the day was done And I sat in regret Of all the things Ive done For all That Ive blessed And all that Ive wronged In dreams Until my death I will wander on In your house I long to be Room by room patiently Ill wait for you there Like a stone Ill wait for you there Alone Alone
