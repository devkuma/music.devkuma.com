                Somethins burnin I cant figure out what Its either lust or a cloud of dust Judgement is clouded must Just be the powder from the power of love But Im in somethin I dont know How to get out of Left my girl in the house alone Is that mysoon to be spouses moan And the further I walked allowed her I paused for a minute to make certain Thats what I heard Cuz after all this is her place So I gave her the benefit of the doubt Think I might be about Busta Busta The thoughts so scary yo that it hurts brace Hope it aint there we go yo Cuz my head already goes to worst case Scenario though in the first place But you confirmed my low end theory though Shouldve known when I made it All the way to third base And that was only the first date Coulda made it to home plate But you slid straight for the dome and dove Face first no you dont understand I dont do this for anyone ever Yeah that aint what they all say Ill say it You can suck a softball Through a straw used to be my fiance Til you sucked on Wayne Andre and Kanye Lebron Akon Jay Lil Jon Raekwon Mase Polow Tha Don Drake Dante Ross James Conway Kwame Guess Im gettin my goddamn Jigga on Cuz your name Im beyond sayin But xuck it Im movin on You women are all cray but Ill probably Always keep on playin the game of Love love la la la la la love She doesnt love me No she dont love me no more She hates my company Yeah she dont love me no more I tried to get her up out of my head As my bags hit the door She screamed she loves me Like she never did before And I told her go where you want and Go do what you want to do I dont care And I told her go where you want and Go do what you want to do I dont care I told that xitch Im a sucker for love Youre a sucker for dick Suckin dick in your mommas tub Til your granny walked in Told the stupid xigga to duck Under the water he drowned Like an abortion They booked you for manslaughter You beat the case and I called you Sherane is not available now Leave a message at the tone And Kendrick dont forget to buy Two pair of those expensive heels You little xuckin ferris wheel Xuckin spendin on me xuck you think We gon get married still Xuckin Mary had a little lamb This aint no fairy tale Fairy godmomma better tell you How I xuckin feel like you should Xuckin beat it or xuckin eat it While Im on my period Now have a blessed day Xitch you serious Im in the mirror With this look on my face curious Why you aint xuckin with me You cut me up a Caesarean You know I want you bad As a Benjamin Im delirious I want you bad as the head Shattered on George Zimmerman After the Dillinger hit em diligently And killin him His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem Thats analogy and metaphor for yah I should win a medal For all the ways I adore yah This is me talkin poetry Yeah I got some home trainin That aint what you like aint it What about if I was famous as Marshall Would you give fellatio In the carpool cops pull us over They just wanna know if you gargle singin I hope shes good enough Meanwhile youre chasin her Chlamydia couldnt even get rid of her Pity the fool that pity the fool in me Ima live with the game of Love love la la la la la love She doesnt love me No she dont love me no more She hates my company Yeah she dont love me no more I tried to get her up out of my head As my bags hit the door She screamed she loves me Like she never did before And I told her go where you want and Go do what you want to do I dont care And I told her go where you want and Go do what you want to do I dont care So needless to say Im feeling betrayed Snatched my house key off my keychain She jumped off WeeBey from The Wire escape Now shes chasin me with a cheese grater Here goes that broken record cliche Its all my fault anyway Shes turnin the tables Im a beat break Treats my face like seratos She cuts and scratches like a DJ Each day is an instant replay They sayin we display Cinethematic abatic behavior back together But forgot today was her bday Cut me off on the freeway Simple misunderstandin But just as I went to slam on the brakes Then I realized that She may be as crazy as me wait Xitch cut my xuckin brake line Stepped on them xuckers 8 times Still goin 73 thank God Theres an exit coming up But them other X U C Ks All wouldve hit the off ramp So I coast into a gosh Damned aww hit a xuckin tree Now here she comes at full speed Shes racin at me Okay You wanna xuck with me eh Snatch the xitch out her car Through the window she screamin I body slam her onto the cement Until the concrete Gave and created a sinkhole Bury this stink ho in it Then payed to have the street repaved Xuck woke up in a dream State in a cold sweat like I got hit With a freeze ray durin a heat wave Guess I eventually caved though Cause shes layin next to me in bed Directly aimin a gat at my head Woke up again and jumped up Like xuck it Ive had it Im checkin into rehab I confess Im a static addict I guess thats why Im so clingy Every girl Ive ever had either says I got to much baggage Or Im too xuckin dramatic Man what the xuck is the matter Im just a xucking romantic I xucking love you you xucking xitch Combative possessive in fact last time I was mad at an ex I actually set off a chain reaction A tragic event I said hit the road And after she left I sent that xitch a text I said be careful driving Dont read this and have a accident She glanced to look at it And wrecked too bad Thought we had a connect No sense dwelling makes Never been a more compelling case Than a model covered in LOreal and mace Who fell from grace Eleven stories for story telling But the whore was yelling rape So the vocal cords were swelling And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings face Still they swarm the gates And my fans making stakes To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace Unless youre Andrea Yates Dont ask me for a date Dont be late Well the sentiments great But wait then theres been a mistake You want an intimate date I wanna intimidate I have infinite hate in my blood Its mainly because of the game of Wait dinner at eight I have infinite hate in my blood Its mainly because of the game of Love love la la la la la love

                Feels like a close its coming to Xuck am I gonna do Its too late to start over This is the only thing I thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways To word the same old song Ever since I came a long From the day the song called Hi My Name Is dropped Started thinking my name was fault Cause any time things went wrong I was the one Who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent Of a modernday Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only Entertainment dog gangsta nah Courageous balls had to change my style They said Im way too soft And I sound like AZ Nas Out came the claws and the fangs Been out since then but up Until the instant that I went against it It was ingrained in me That I wouldnt amount to a xhit stain I thought no wonder I had to unlearn Everything my brain was taught Do I really belong In this game I pondered I just wanna play my part Should I make waves or not So back and forth in my brain The Tugowar wages on I dont wanna seem Ungrateful or disrespect The art form I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face Before you get made pissed off Keep pluggin its your only outlet And your only outfit so you know Theyre gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it Quick and make it ah feel like Ive already Said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing Different ways that rhyme What I really wanna say is If theres anyone else That can relate to my story Betcha feel the same way I felt when I was In the same place you are I was a afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out Afraid Id never be found I dont wanna go another round An angry mans power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house With tiptoed love Run out of excuses for everyone So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear the time is near Guts over fear I shed a tear For all the times I let you push me round And let you keep me down Now I got guts over fear Guts over fear Feels like a close its coming to Xuck am I gonna do Its too late to start over This is the only thing I thing I know I know what its like I was there once Single parents hate your appearance Did you struggle to find your place In this world and the pain spawns All the anger on but it wasnt Until I put the pain in songs Learned who to aim it on That I made a spark Started to spit hard as xhit Learned how to harness it While the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre xhit But the crazy part was soon as I stopped Saying I gave a xuck Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart To look at all the pain Ive caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone And the lights go out in that trailer park And the window is closing And theres nowhere else That I can go with flows And Im frozen cause theres no more Emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs That I make for fun So to the break of dawn Here I go recycling the same old song But Id rather make Not Afraid 2 Then another motharxuckin We Made You uh And I dont wanna seem indulgent When I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise Pray to God I just opened enough Eyes later on gave you the supplies And the tools to hopefully use Thatll make ya strong Enough to lift yourself up When you feel like I felt Cause I cant explain to yall How dang exhausted my legs felt Just havin to balance my xang self When on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you ma cuz that gave me the Strength to cuz Shadymania So when they empty that stadium Least I made it outta that house And a found a place in this world When the day was done So this is for every kid Who alls they ever did was dreamt of One day just getting accepted I represent him or her anyone similar You are the reason that I made this song And everything youre scared To say dont be afraid to say no more From this day forward Just let them xholes talk Take it with a grain of salt And eat their xuckin faces off The legend of the angry blonde Lives on through you When Im gone and to think I was a afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out Afraid Id never be found I dont wanna go another round An angry mans power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house With tiptoed love Run out of excuses for everyone So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear the time is near Guts over fear I shed a tear For all the times I let you push me round And let you keep me down Now I got guts over fear Guts over fear

                On a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair warm smell of colitas rising up through the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a suimmering light My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night These she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell He said And I was thinking to myself this could be heaven and this could be hell Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place such a lovely place such a lovely face plenty of room at the Hotel California Any time of year any time of year you can find it here Her mind is Tiffany twisted She got the Mercedes Benz She got a lot of pretty pretty boys that she calls friends How they dance in the courtyard sweet summer sweet Some dance to remember some dance to forget So I called up the captain Please bring me my wine He said We havent had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine and still those voices are calling from far away wake you up in the middle of the night just to here them say Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place such a lovely place such a lovely face They living it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise what a nice surprise bring your alibis Mirrors on the ceiling the pink champagne on ice and she said We are all just prisoners here of our own device And in the masters chambers they gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives but they just cant kill the beast Last thing I remember I was running for the door I had to find the passage back to the place I was before Relax said the night man We are programmed to receive You can check out any time you like but you can never leave

                It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine Last name ever first name greatest Like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothing To play with started off local But thanks to all the haters I know G4 pilots on a first name basis In your city faded off the brown Nino She insists she got more class we know Swimming in the money come and find me Nemo If I was at the club You know I balled chemo Drop the mixtape That xhit sounded like an album Whod a thought a country Wide tourd be the outcome Labels want my name Beside the X like Malcolm Everybody got a deal I did it without one Yeah xigga Im about my business Killing all these rappers You would swear I had a hit list Everyone who doubted me is Asking for forgiveness If you aint been a part of it At least you got to witness xitches It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Everever Mr West is in the building Aint no question who about to kill em I used to have hood dreams Big fame big chains I stuck my xick inside this life Until that xitch came I went hard all fall like the ball teams Just so I can make it rain all spring Yall seen my story my glory I had raped the game young You can call it statutory When a xigga blow up They gon build statues for me Old money Benjamin Button what nothing Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin You would think I ran the world Like Michelles husband You would think these xiggas know me When they really doesnt Like they was down with the old me no You xucking wasnt Youre such a xucking loser He didnt even go to class Bueller Trade the Grammy plaques Just to have my granny back Remember she had that bad hip Like a fanny pack chasing the stardom Will turn you to a maniac All the way in Hollywood And I cant even act They pull their cameras out And godxamn he snap I used to want this thing forever Yall can have it back It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine OK hello its the Martian Space Jam Jordans I want this xhit forever Wake up and smell the garden Fresher than the harvest Step up to the target if I had one guess Then I guess Im just New Orleans And I will never stop Like Im running from the cops Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur To the top life is such a xucking Roller coaster then it drops But what should I scream for This is my theme park my mind shine even When my thoughts seem dark Pistol on my side You dont wanna hear that thing talk Let the king talk check the price And pay attention Lil Wayne Thats what they gotta say or mention Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover Shhh my foots sleeping on the gas No brake pads no such thing as last uh It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine There they go packing stadiums As Shady spits his flow Nuts they go macadamian They go so ballistic whoa He can make them look like Bozos Hes wondering if he should spit this slow Xuck no go for broke His cup just runneth over oh no He aint had him a buzz like this Since the last time that he overdosed Theyve been waiting patiently For Pinocchio to poke his nose Back into the game and they know Rap will never be the same as before Bashing in the brains of these hoes And establishing the name as he goes The passion and the flame is ignited You cant put it out once we light it This xhit is exactly what the xuck That Im talking about when we riot You dealing with a few true villains Who stand inside of a booth truth spilling And spit true feelings until our tooth Fillings come flying up Out of our mouths now rewind it Pay back motherxucker for the way That you got at me hows it taste When I slap the taste out Your mouth with the bass so loud That it shakes the place Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case Youre thinking of saving face You aint gonna have no face to save By the time Im through With this place so Drake It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine
