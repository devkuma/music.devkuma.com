                Dear mother can you hear me whining Its been three whole weeks Since I have left your home This sudden fear has left me trembling Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own And Im feeling so alone Pay attention to the cracked streets And the broken homes Some call it the slums some call it nice I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home welcome to paradise A gunshot rings out at the station Another urchin snaps and Left dead on his own It makes me wonder why Im still here For some strange reason its now Feeling like my home and Im never gonna go Pay attention to the cracked streets And the broken homes Some call it the slums some call it nice I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home welcome to paradise  Dear mother can you hear me laughing Its been six whole months Since I have left your home It makes me wonder why Im still here For some strange reason its now Feeling like my home and Im never gonna go Pay attention to the cracked streets And the broken homes Some call it the slums some call it nice I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home welcome to paradise
