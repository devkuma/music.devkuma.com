                Look if you had One shot one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted One moment would you capture it Or just let it slip yo his palms are sweaty Knees weak arms are heavy Theres vomit on his sweater Alredy moms spaghetti hes nervous But on the surface he looks calm And ready to drop bombs But he keeps on forgettin What he wrote down the whole crowd Goes so loud yo he open his mouth But the words wont come out Hes chokin how everybodys jokin now The clocks run out times up over bloah Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity Oh there goes rabbit he choked Hes so mad but he wont Give up that is he no he wont have it He knows his whole back citys ropes I dont matter hes dope He knows that but hes broke Hes so stacked that he knows When he goes back to his mobile home Thats when its back to the lab again yo This whole rap shit he better go capture This moment and hope it dont pass him You better lose yourself In the music the moment You own it you better never let it go ho You only get one shot do not miss Your chance to blow this opportunity Comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself In the music the moment You own it you better Never let it go ho you only get one shot Do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once In a lifetime you better The souls escaping through this hole That its gaping this world is mine For the taking make me king As we move toward a new world order A normal life is borin but superstardoms Close to post mortar it only grows harder Only grows hotter he blows us all over These hoes is all on him Coast to coast shows hes know As the globetrotter lonely roads God only knows hes know father From home hes no father He goes home and barely knows His own daughter but hold your nose Cuz here goes the cold water His hoes dont want him no mo Hes cold product they moved on To the next schmoe who flows He nose dove and sold nada So the soap opera is told and unfolds I suppose its old potna But the beat goes on da da dum de dom You better lose yourself In the music the moment You own it you better never let it go ho You only get one shot do not miss Your chance to blow this opportunity Comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself In the music the moment You own it you better never let it go ho You only get one shot do not miss Your chance to blow this opportunity comes Once in a lifetime you better No more games Im a change What you call rage tear this mothafuckin Roof off like 2 doas cased I was playing in the beginning The mood all changed I been chewed up And spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin and stepwritin The next cypher best believe Somebodys payin the pied piper All the pain inside amplified by the fact That I cant get by with my 9 to 5 And I cant provide the right type of Life for my family cuz man These goddam food stamps Dont buy diapers and its no movie Theres no Mekhi phifer This is my life and these times Are so hard and its getting Even harder trying to feed And water my seed plus see dishonor Caught up between bein a father And a prima donna baby mama dramas Screamin on and too much for me To wanna stay in one spot Another jam or not has gotten me To the point Im like a snail Ive got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot success is My only mothafuckin option failures not Mam I love you but this trail has Got to go I cannot grow old In salems lot so here I go is my shot Feet fail me not cuz maybe The only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself In the music the moment You own it you better never let it go ho You only get one shot do not miss Your chance to blow this opportunity Comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself In the music the moment You own it you better never let it go ho You only get one shot do not miss Your chance to blow this opportunity Come once in a lifetime You better you can do anything You set your mind to man
