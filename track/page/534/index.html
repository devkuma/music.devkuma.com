                You saw me crying in the chapel The tears I shed were tears of joy I know the meaning of contentment Now Im happy with the Lord Just a plain and simple chapel Where humble people go to pray I pray the Lord that Ill grow stronger As I live from day to day I searched and I searched But I couldnt find no way on earth To gain please of mind now Im happy In the chapel where people Are of one accord yes we gather In the chapel just to sing and Praise the Lord youll search And youll search but youll never find No way on earth to gain peace of mind Take you troubles to the chapel Get down on your knees and pray Then your burdens will be lighter And youll surely find the way
