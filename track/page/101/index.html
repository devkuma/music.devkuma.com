                I left alone my mind was blank I needed time to think to get the Memories from my mind What did I see can I believe That what I saw that night was real And not just fantasy Just what I saw in my old dreams Were they reflections of my warped mind Staring back at me Cos in my dreams its always there The evil face that twists my mind And brings me to despair  The night was black Was no use holding back Cos I just had to see Was someone watching me In the mist dark figures move and twist Was all this for real Or just some kind of hell 666 the number of the beast Hell and fire was spawned to be released Torches blazed and sacred Chants were praised As they start to cry Hands held to the sky In the night the fires burning bright The ritual has begun Satans work is done 666 the number of the beast Sacrifice is going on tonight  This cant go on I must inform the law Can this still be real Or just some crazy dream But I feel drawn towards The evil chanting hordes They seem to mesmerise me Cant avoid their eyes 666 the number of the beast 666 the one for you and me Im coming back I will return And Ill possess your body And Ill make you burn I have the fire I have the force I have the power to make My evil take its course

                Think of me think of me fondly When weve said goodbye Remember me once in a while Please promise me youll try When you find that once again you long To take your heart back and be free If you ever find a moment Spare a thought for me  We never said our love was evergreen Or as unchanging as the sea But if you can still remember Stop and think of me Think of all the things Weve shared and seen Dont think about the things Which might have been Think of me think of me waking Silent and resigned Imagine me trying too hard to Put you from my mind Recall those days look back On all those times Think of the things well never do There will never be a day When I wont think of you  Can it be can it be Christine bravo Long ago it seems so long ago How young and innocent we were She may not remember me But I remember her Flowers fade the fruits of summer fade They have their season so do we But please promise me that sometimes You will think ah of me
