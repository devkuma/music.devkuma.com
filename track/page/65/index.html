                I will leave my heart at the door I wont say a word Theyve all been said before you know So why dont we just play pretend Like were not scared of what is coming next Or scared of having nothing left  Look dont get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is  If this is my last night with you Hold me like Im more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again  I dont need your honesty Its already in your eyes And Im sure my eyes they speak for me No one knows me like you do And since youre the only one that matters Tell me who do I run to  Look dont get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is  If this is my last night with you Hold me like Im more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again  Let this be our lesson in love Let this be the way we remember us I dont wanna be cruel or vicious And I aint asking for forgiveness All I ask is  If this is my last night with you Hold me like Im more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again  All I Ask Adele
