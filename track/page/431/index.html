                Cut my hair just  because I thought that  Maybe things  would change  Laughing at me  and the things you see  Tell me  whos to blame  Falls to the ground  floating  Just like gold dust  its sparkling  Taking me back  to the start  My spirits  are darkening  It makes me  feel so weak  Looking for a reason  why I cant comprehend  I feel the lightness  in my head  Now my thoughts  are clouded  By strange things  I see  For every breath  I take every day  Every drop of blood  every stain  Like the moon  I will wax and wane  Circles  complete  For all the promises  that I keep  All the nights  when I cant sleep  Every time that  I held your hand  Lician far gesund  gemynd  Shake of the hand  another demand  But what  does it mean  Cry through the pain  its always the same  Will it  ever heal  Though broken bones  and the wounds I bear  They may heal  one day  Somewhere inside  theres an empty place  And a price  to pay  Hiding from the  flicker of the light  Before dawn  I turn away  And close my eyes  Gonna hold back  Tears til the sadness  is gone  Until the fever  will dissipate  Til I know  how I feel today  Gonna rise up to  meet my fate  Circles  complete  For all the times  youve been by my side  All the good times  that pass us by  If I cant find you  in the dark  Lician far gesund  gemynd  Sometimes words  they fade away  The meaning  gets lost in the dark  Just learn to let go  the past is gone  You never know  what the future holds  Sand in my toes  I walk all alone  On this  lonely shore  Deep in the darkness  a vision  So fine  Its beautiful  A sudden stop  then I realize  Turn around  now I wanna cry  I have found  where the secrets lie  I see it  now  I wave a hand  to the brand new day  And the pain  has all gone away  These new feelings  that love betrays  I sing a song  so sweet  Someone in need  A song for someone  Who has come to  the end of the line
