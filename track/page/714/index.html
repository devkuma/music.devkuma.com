                Its nine oclock on a Saturday The regular crowd shuffles in Theres an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin  He says son can you play me a memory Im not really sure how it goes But its sad and its sweet And I knew it complete When I wore a younger mans Clothes na na na na na Sing us a song youre the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well were all in the mood for a melody And youve got us feeling alright  Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And hes quick with a joke Or to light up your smoke But theres someplace that hed rather be He says Bill I believe this is killing me As the smile ran away from his face Well Im sure that I could be A movie star if I could get out Of this place na na na na na Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And hes talking with Davy Whos still in the navy And probably will be for life  And the waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes theyre sharing a drink They call loneliness But its better than drinking alone  Sing us a song youre the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well were all in the mood for a melody And youve got us feeling alright  Its a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager give me a smile Cause he knows that its me Theyve been coming to see To forget about life for a while And the piano it sounds Like a carnival and the microphone Smells like a beer and they sit at the bar And put bread in my jar And say man what are you doing here Oh na na na na na Sing us a song youre the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well were all in the mood for a melody And youve got us feeling alright
