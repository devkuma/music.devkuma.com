                Im liable to start a violent spark With a silent thought I disgust you like dialogue From the shop to the wired frog Night club xhit I was taught If your CDs on fire You had to put it out yourself Like Highland Park no fire department So you might not hear sirens at all But dont be alarmed if I sound off Something just aint right with me dawg A martyr on a private charter Whose life could be harder Widely regarded highly bite me sweetheart Im slightly xetarded But tonight Im starting xhit Im feeling self righteous I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac xhit Looking to box with anybody Disorderly conduct Ill xuck around and snort a key And pick a fight with a locksmith Fan of the LOX bananas manic Im going in shock frantic Im trapped in a closet Panic attack cause Im claustrophobic no xaggot I mean I cant maneuver from movement Cause I have no room for improvement Im practically squashed Unpacked it and boxed it Toxic hands are arsenic Flammable bars examine the content Bar exam start of insanity Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson Animal snarls cannibal jaws Shark mandibles lambs to the slaughter Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking Anthony Hopkins with his hands In his pockets black out Zach Galifianakis gallons of vodka But that gal has some knockers I bet you they ring a bell When I come back and Im conscious What happened doc I passed out again Alcohols making me break into Vacants naked stole a magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun Fell asleep watching Fear factor and scare tactics Too close to the StairMaster Poked a hole in the air Mattress and popped it woke up shortly Thereafter hungover no underwear grasping A Bayer Aspirin and dropped it Air Max in my closet preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich And the cross stitching is A cross mixing of a rhinoceros Possum skin giraffe and a dolphin Fin cotton Dockers OshKoshes Drop crotches Swatch watches And sneakers matches with the Parkers But its like being overstaffed At a boxing gym with all these trainers But I dont have any boxers And Im standing here naked Hangover still wasted like paper You write raps on obnoxious Yo why does it always sound Like Im grabbing my nostrils Xuck that Ill battle em all Ill battle a mall Ill stand there And yell that at a wall Until the mannequin doll Scatter and the inanimate objects That Im battering all shatter and fall Cause I hear the track And Im starting to get xucking amped Ima spark plug Im like the car With the cables hooked up To my xucking back Im a Duracell But I sure as hell got it backwards Cause yall could get jumped And Id catch the battery charge But I got a hunch like your back When its arching when I start attacking Your squadron youll feel like MasterCard when Im charging So take a swipe at me Im coming straight at you Like Clay Matthews From the Green Bay Packers So get the sack of Wisconsin Thats nutbag that Im talking Who am I kidding You xaggots are all gonna do my bidding Dont get dragged to the auction Neiman Marcus bags of Vuitton and all Ill push a xitch into oncoming traffic Just watch this stretched tinted Black sedan my xss see how mad you act When I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave In a xucking taxi cab to go shopping Affable guy next door is laughable My next whores gonna have mechanical arms Thatll jack me off With a lotion dispenser With a motion sensor no emotion Hence I guess this sick prick dies hard I got a Magic Johnson its like a magic wand Allows me to not let a blonde arouse me If Ronda Rousey was on the couch With the condoms out holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me Ill laugh in response to How she dances and flaunts it around me Her flat little xadonkadonk is Bouncing around and all I see is Paulie Malign now Shes slaughterhouse in a blouse And Madonna with mud on her Xoddammit I am misogynist I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster Throw her off a balcony Just so happens shes fond of algae Cause now shes faceplants On the concrete complete Lack of responsibility Half you xssholes aint strong enough To pick up a spirit xhit You xags couldnt shoplift At a thrift shop But I let the track lift em up Boost the energy klepto Im back to rip shop up But my thing is this now Fivefinger discount been rapping so long Ive been killing this xhit Its easy kidnapping your mom Cause Im still in this xitch thievery Ransom for JonBenet Ramsey Chandra Levy and Gary Condit Paul was scared That if I went back to the blonde I might relapse get on some bullxhit Perhaps Ill launch some cracker Taunts at action Bronson Macklemore Mac Miller and Asher Roth And have some back and forths And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamars control verse And perform fack in concert Yo I put that xhit On a greatest hits album Now that was awesome It takes some massive balls to Do some xhit like that Sometimes I have to ponder Why people are like Ill stick around And put up with my crap so long for Whats the attraction mama Is it the fact that Im a walking talking Actual quadruple entendre Or the pointy nose Thats pointing at you mama Who knows at this point Its always poking so meh Still get along with this voice Cause thats the monster So dosido with a sociopath Everyone who knows me knows that What they dont know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio meh She loves the way I lie Sits on my face and waits For my nose to grow pathological liar Oh why am I such an xsshole That my disguise is pants But they on fire so am I Cappadonna cut the track off Sabotage Christmas crap in your stocking Im wrapping up all the presents In xucking camouflage So you cant even find em Jack Santa Claus snap Rudolphs antlers off Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage And blind him blowing the head Gasket at bed bath and beyond Put the basket back while the bath salt Packets are gone I Know you really tired of me Sampling Billy Squier but classic rock Acid rap is the genre got slash on guitar Splashing bizarre thrasher and Aerosmith And Im a spectacular archer Feed count Dracula Chocula Godzilla half dragon and Bob Dylan Bandwagoners Im kicking the xamn Stragglers off and Im strangling em Smack Kim Basinger on a xss

robot So call me rapbot But for me to rap like a computer Must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My penll go off when I halfcock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a living and a killing off it Ever since Bill Clinton was Still in office with Monica Lewinsky Feeling on his nutsack Im an MC still as honest But as rude and indecent As all hell syllables killaholic Kill em all with This slickety gibbedy hibbedy hip hop You dont really wanna Get into a pissing match With this rappidy rap Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac Pack backpack rap yep yacketyyak The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts While Im practicing That Ill still be able to Break a motherxuckin table Over the back of a couple of xaggots And crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to aftermath After the fact how could I not blow All I do is drop Fbombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period Heres a maxipad Its actually disastrously bad For the wack while Im masterfully Constructing this masterpiece as Im beginning to feel like a rap God rap God All my people from the front to the Back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long Enough to slap box slap box Let me show you maintaining This shit aint that hard that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap Immortality like I have got Well to be truthful the blueprints Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the moon since MCs get taken to school with this music Cause I use it As a vehicle to bust a rhyme Now I lead a new school Full of students me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz 2Pac NWA Cube Hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy Thank you they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet Run DMC and induct them Into the motherxuckin Rock n roll Hall of Fame Even though I walk in the church And burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You xags think its all a game Til I walk a flock of flames Off of planking tell me What in the xuck are you thinking Little gay looking boy So gay I can barely say it With a straight face looking boy You witnessing a massacre Like you watching a church Gathering take place looking boy Oy vey that boys gay Thats all they say looking boy You get a thumbs up pat on the back And a way to go from your label Every day looking boy hey looking boy What you say looking boy I got a hell yeah from Dre looking boy Ima work for everything I have Never ask nobody for xhit Get outta my face looking boy Basically boy youre never gonna be capable To keep up with the same pace looking boy Cause Im beginning to Feel like a rap God rap God All my people from the front to the Back nod back nod The way Im racing around the track Call me NASCAR NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park The White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard So you be Thor and Ill be Odin You rodent Im omnipotent Let off then Im reloading Immediately with these bombs Im totin And I should not be woken Im the walking dead But Im just a talking head A zombie floating But I got your mom deep throating Im out my ramen noodle We have nothing in common poodle Im a doberman pinch yourself In the arm and pay homage pupil Its me my honestys brutal But its honestly futile If I dont utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle Enough rhymes to maybe to try And help get some people Through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me Like its lunchtime I know there was a time Where once I was king of the underground But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes But sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and Here they come trying to Censor you like that one line I said on Im back from the Mathers LP One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine Put em all in a line add an AK47 A revolver and a nine See if I get away with it now That I aint as big as I was but Ive Morphed into an immortal Coming through the portal Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I dont know what the xuck that you Rhyme for youre pointless As Rapunzel with xucking cornrows Youre like normal xuck being normal And I just bought a new Ray gun from the future To just come and shoot ya Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a xag At Maywhethers pad singin to a man While they played piano Man oh man that was a 247 Special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio Station the very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed JJ Faduh sama lamaa duma lamaa You assuming Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything You saying ricocheting off of me And itll glue to you Im never stating More than never demonstrating How to give a motherxuckin Audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know that The haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyd be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music You make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do When they get jealous they confuse it Its not hip hop its pop Cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on lose yourself and make em lose it I dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to use Let me know when it occurs to you While Im ripping any one of These verses diverse as you Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if youre half as nice at songs You can sacrifice virgins too uh School flunkie pill junky But look at the accolades The skills brung me full of myself But still hungry I bully myself Cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you ill When I speak in tongues But its still tongue in cheek xuck you Im drunk so Satan take the xucking wheel Im asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boys Still chunky but funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils Heres what they want from me They asking me to eliminate Some of the women hate But if you take into consideration The bitter hatred that I had Then you may be a little Patient and more Sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But xuck it Lifes handing you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the xuck am I supposed to Bake them a cake then Dont mistake it for Satan Its a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and Dont be a retard be a king think not Why be a king when you can be a God
