                Didnt I tell you everything Is possible in this deja vu Try the river boat the carousel Feed the pigeons Bar B Q Look at all the people happy faces all around Smiling throwing kisses Busy making lazy sounds Its a bright June afternoon It never gets dark wah wah Here comes the sun get your green Green tambourine lets play in the park Wah wah here comes the sun Some folks are on blankets Slowly daydreaming and reaching For their food lets go buy An ice cream and a magazine With an attitude and put on a cassette We can pretend that youre a star Cos lifes so very simple Just like la la la its a bright June afternoon it never gets dark Wah wah here comes the sun Get your green green tambourine Lets play in the park wah wah Here comes the sun comes the sun Theres a painter painting His masterpiece there are some Squirrels jumping in the trees Theres a wide eyed boy With a red balloon all my life Ive longed for this afternoon  Its a bright June afternoon It never gets dark wah wah Here comes the sun get your green Green tambourine lets play in the park Wah wah here comes the sun Its a bright June afternoon Lets play in the park wah wah Here comes the sun get your green Green tambourine it never gets dark Wah wah here comes the sun It never gets dark lets play in the park  Lets play in the park here comes the sun
