                As I walk through the valley Of the shadow of death I take a look at my life And realize theres nothing left Cause Ive been blasting and laughing So long that even my momma Thinks that my mind has gone But I aint never crossed a man That didnt deserve it Me be treated like a punk You know thats unheard of You betta watch how ya talking And where ya walking or you and your homies Might be lined in chalk I really hate to trip but I gotta loc As they croak I see myself In the pistol smoke fool Im the kinda g That little homies wanna be like On my knees in the night Saying prayers in the street light Been spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Been spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Look at the situation they got me facing I cant live a normal life I was raised by the state So I gotta be down with the hood team Too much television watching Got me chasing dreams Im an educated fool with money on my mind Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye Im a locked out gangster Set tripping banger and my homies are down So dont arouse my anger fool Death aint nothing but a heart beat away Im living life do or die What can I say Im twenty three now Will I ever live to see twenty four The way things is going I dont know Tell me why are we so blind to see That the ones we hurt are you and me Been spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Been spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Power in the money money in the power Minute after minute hour after hour Everybodys running But half of them aint looking Its going on in the kitchen But I dont know whats cooking They say I gotta learn But nobodys here to teach me If they cant understand it How can they reach me I guess they cant I guess they wont I guess they front thats why I know my life is out of luck foo Been spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Been spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsters paradise Tell me why are we so blind to see That the ones we hurt are you and me Tell me why are we so blind to see That the ones we hurt are you and me
