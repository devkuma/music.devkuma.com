                Lost in a dream nothing Is what it seems searching my head For the words that you said Tears filled my eyes as we said Our last goodbyes this sad scene Replays of you walking away My body aches from mistakes Betrayed by lust we lied to each other So much that in nothing we trust Time and again she repeats Lets be friends I smile and say yes Another trust bends I must confess I try to let go but I know Well never end til were dust We lied to each other again But I wish I could trust My body aches from mistakes Betrayed by lust we lied to each other So much that in Nothing we trust God help me please On my knees betrayed by lust We lied to each other so much Now theres nothing we trust  My body aches from mistakes Betrayed by lust we lied to each other So much now theres nothing We trust God help me please On my knees betrayed by lust We lied to each other so much Now theres nothing we trust My body aches from mistakes Betrayed by lust we lied to each other So much nothing we trust oh Absolutely nothing we trust

                I remember every little thing As if it happened only yesterday Parking by the lake and there was Not another car in sight And I never had a girl looking any better Than you did and all the kids At school they were wishing They were me that night And now our bodies are oh so close and tight It never felt so good it never felt so right And were glowing like the metal On the edge of a knife glowing like the metal On the edge of a knife Though its cold and lonely In deep dark night I can see paradise By the dashboard light Aint no doubt about it We were doubly blessed Cause we were barely seventeen And we were barely dressed Aint no doubt about it Baby got to go and shout it Aint no doubt about it We were doubly blessed Cause we were barely seventeen And we were barely dressed Baby doncha hear my heart You got it drowning out the radio Ive been a waiting so long For you to come along and have some fun And I gotta let ya know No youre never gonna regret it So open up your eyes I got a big surprise Itll feel all right well I wanna make Your motor run and now our bodies are oh so close and tight It never felt so good it never felt so right And were glowing like the metal On the edge of a knife glowing like the metal On the edge of a knife Come on hold on tight Oh come on hold on tight Though its cold and loneley In the deep dark night I can see paradise by the dashboard light Though its cold and lonely In the deep dark night Paradise by the dashboard light You got to do what you can And let mother nature do the rest Aint no doubt about it We were doubly blessed cause we were Barely seventeen and we were barely Were gonna go all the way tonight Were gonna go all the way Tonights the night gonna go All the way tonight were gonna go All the way tonights the night Gonna go all the way tonight Were gonna go all the way Tonights the night gonna go All the way tonight were gonna go All the way tonights the night  Stop right there I gotta know right now Before we go any further Do you love me will you love me Forever Do you need me Will you never leave me Will you make me so happy For the rest of my life Will you take me away and will you make me Your wife Do you love me Will you love me forever Do you need me will you never Leave me will you make me So happy for the rest of my life Will you take me away And will you make me your wife I gotta know right now before we go Any further do you love me Will you love me forever Let me sleep on it baby baby Let me sleep on it let me sleep on it Ill give you my answer In the morning let me sleep on it Baby baby let me sleep on it Let me sleep on it Ill give you My answer in the morning Let me sleep on it baby baby Let me sleep on it oh let me sleep on it Ill give you my answer In the morning I gotta know right now Do you love me will you love me Forever do you need me Will you never leave me Will you make me so happy for the rest Of my life will you take me away Will you make me your wife I gotta know right now before we go Any further do you love me And will you love me forever  Let me sleep on it baby baby Let me sleep on it let me sleep on it Ill give you my answer In the morning let me sleep on it Baby baby let me sleep on it Let me sleep on it Ill give you My answer morning oh morning My answer in the morning Know right now before we go Any further do you love me Will you love me forever Let me sleep on it let me sleep on it I couldnt take it any longer Lord I was crazed and when the feeling Came upon me like a tidal wave Started swearing to my god And on my mothers grave That I would love you to the end of time I swore that I would love you To the end of time so now Im praying For the end of time to hurry up and arrive Cause if I gotta spend another minute With you I dont think That I can really survive Ill never break my promise Or forget my vow but God only knows What I can do right now Im praying for the end of time Its all that I can do Praying for the end of time So I can end my time with you It was long ago and it was far away And it was so much better Than it is today

                Theres a little bird That somebody sends down to the earth To live on the wind born on the wind And he sleeps on the wind This little a bird that somebody sends Hes light and fragile And feathered sky blue So thin and graceful the sun shines Through this little a bird That lives on the wind This little a bird that somebody sends He flys so high up in the sky Out of reach of human eye And the only time that he touches the around Is when that little a bird Is when that little a bird Is when that little a bird dies
