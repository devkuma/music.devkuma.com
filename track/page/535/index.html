                When they begin the beguine It brings back the sound of music So tender it brings back The night of tropical splendour It brings back a memory evergreen Im with you once more under the stars And down by the shore an orchestras playing And even the palms seems to be swaying When they begin the beguine To live it again is past all endeavour Except when that tune clutches my heart And there we are swearing to love Forever and promising never Never to part what moments divine What raptures serene till clouds came Along to disperse the joys we had tasted And now when I hear people curse The chance that was wasted I know but too well what they mean So dont let them begin the beguine Let the love that was once a fire Remain an ember let it sleep Like the dead desire I only remember When they begin the beguine Oh yes let them begin the beguine Make them play till the stars That were there before return above you Till you whisper to me once more Darling I love you and we suddenly know What heaven were in When they begin the beguine
