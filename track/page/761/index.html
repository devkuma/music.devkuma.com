                See the tree how big its grown But friend it hasnt been too long It wasnt big I laughed at her And she got mad the first day That she planted it was just a twig Then the first snow came and she ran out To brush the snow away so it wouldnt die Came running in all excited Slipped and almost hurt herself And I laughed till I cried She was always young at heart Kinda dumb and kinda smart And I loved her so and I surprised her With a puppy kept me up All christmas eve two years ago And it would sure embarrass her When I came in from working late Cause I would know that shed been Sitting there and crying Over some sad and silly late late show And honey I miss you and Im beinning good And Id love to be with you If only I could she wrecked the car And she was sad and so afraid That Id be mad but what the heck Though I pretended hard to be Guess you could say she saw Through me and hugged my neck I came home unexpectedly And caught her crying needlessly In the middle of a day and it was In the early spring when flower bloom And robins sing she went away And honey I miss you and Im beinning good And Id love to be with you If only I could one day while I was not at home while she was there And all alone the angels came Now all I have is memories of honey And I wake up night and call her name Now my life an empty stage Where honey lived and honey played And love grew up and a small cloud Passed overhead and cries down On the flower bed that honey loved And see the tree how big its grown But friend it hasnt been too long It wasnt big and I laughed at her And she got mad the first day That she planted it was just a twig
