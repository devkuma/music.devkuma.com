                Reverend reverend is this a conspiracy Crucified for no sins no revenge beneath me Lost within my plans for life It all seems so unreal Im a man cut in half In this world left in my misery  The reverend he turned to me Without a tear in his eyes Its nothing new for him to see I didnt ask him why I will remember The love our souls had sworn to make Now I watch the falling rain All my mind can see now is your Well I guess you took my youth I gave it all away like the birth of A newfound joy this love would end In rage and when she died I couldnt cry the pride Within my soul You left me incomplete All alone as the memories now Unfold believe the word I will unlock my door and pass The cemetery gates sometimes When Im alone I wonder aloud If youre watching over me Some place far abound I must reverse my life I cant live in the past Then set my soul free belong to me at last Through all those complex years I thought I was alone I didnt care To look around and make this world My own and when she died I shouldve cried and spared myself Some pain You left me incomplete All alone as the memories Still remain the way we were The chance to save my soul And my concern is now in vain Believe the word I will unlock my door And pass the cemetery gates  The way we were the chance To save my soul and my concern Is now in vain believe the word I will unlock my door and pass The cemetery gates gates gates
