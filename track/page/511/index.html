                I hear the ticking of the clock Im lying here the rooms pitch dark I wonder where you are tonight No answer on your telephone And the night goes by So very slow oh I hope that It wont end though alone Till now I always Got by on my own I never really cared until I met you And now it chills me to the bone How do I get you alone How do I get you alone You dont know how long I have wanted to touch your lips And wait you tight You dont know How long I have waited And I was gonna tell you tonight But the secret is still my own And my love for you Is still unknown alone  Till now I always Got by on my own I never really cared until I met you And now it chills me to the bone How do I get you alone How do I get you alone  How do I get you alone How do I get you alone Alone alone
