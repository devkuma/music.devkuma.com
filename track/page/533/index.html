                Here I stand all alone Have my mind turned to stone Have my heart filled up with ice To avoid its breakin twice Thanks to you my dear old friend But you cant help this is the end Of a tale that wasnt right I wont have no sleep tonight In my heart in my soul I really hate to pay this toll Should be strong young and bold But the only thing I feel is pain Its alright well stay friends Trustin in my confidence And lets say its just alright You wont sleep alone tonight In my heart in my soul I really hate to pay this toll Should be strong young and bold But the only thing I feel is pain  With my heart with my soul Some guys cry you bought and sold Theyve been strong young and bold And they say play this song again In my heart in my soul I really hate to pay this toll Should be strong young and bold But the only thing I feel is pain
