                Morning comes too early And nighttime falls too late And sometimes all I want to do is wait The shadow Ive been hiding in Has fled from me today I know its easier to walk away Than look it in the eye But I will raise a shelter to the sky And here beneath this star Tonight Ill lie She will slowly Yield the light as I awaken From the longest night  Dreams are shaking set sirens Waking up tired eyes with the light The memories all rush into his head By a candle stands a mirror of his heart And soul she dances she was dancing Thru the night above his bed And walking to the window He throws the shutters out Against the wall and from An ivory tower hears her call Let light surround you Its been a long long time Hes had a while to think it over In the end he only sees the change Light to dark dark to light Light to dark dark to light Heaven must be more than this When angels waken with a kiss Sacred hearts wont take the pain But mine will never be the same He stands before the window His shadow slowly fading from the wall And from an ivory tower hears her call Let the light surround you  Once lost but I was found When I heard the stained Glass shatter all around me I sent the spirits tumbling Down the hill but I will hold This one on high above me still She whispers words to clear my mind I once could see but now at last Im blind I know its easier to walk away Than look it in the eye But I had given all that I could take And now Ive only habits left to break Tonight Ill still be lying here Surrounded in all the light
