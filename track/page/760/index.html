                I looked up this morning and the sun was gone Turned on some music to start my day I lost myself in a familiar song I closed my eyes and I slipped away Its more than a feeling More than a feeling And I hear that old song is More than a feeling And I begin dreaming More than a feeling Just see Mary Ann walked away I see my Mary Ann walkin away So many people have come and gone Their faces fade as the years go by Yet I still recall as I wander on As clear as a sound in the summer sky Its more than a feeling More than a feeling And I hear that old song is More than a feeling And I begin dreaming More than a feeling Just see Mary Ann walked away I see my Mary Ann walkin away  When Im tired of thinking cold I hide in my music forget the day And dream of a girl I used to know I closed my eyes and she slipped away She slipped away  Its more than a feeling More than a feeling And I hear that old song is More than a feeling And I begin dreaming More than a feeling Just see Mary Ann walked away

                There lived a certain man in Russia long ago He was big and strong in his eyes a flaming glow Most people looked at him with terror and with fear But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear He could preach the bible like a preacher Full of ecstacy and fire But he also was the kind of teacher Women would desire RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen There was a cat that really was gone RA RA RASPUTIN Russias greatest love machine It was a shame how he carried on  He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar In all affairs of state he was the man to please But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze For the queen he was no wheeler dealer Though shed heard the things hed done She believed he was a hole healer Who would heal her son RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen There was a cat that really was gone RA RA RASPUTIN Russias greatest love machine It was a shame how he carried on But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power became known to more and more people the demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and louder  This mans just got to go declared his enemies But the ladies begged Dont you try to do it please No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms Then one night some men of higher standing Set a trap theyre not to blame Come to visit us they kept demanding And he really came RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen They put some poison into his wine RA RA RASPUTIN Russias greatest love machine He drank it all and he said I feel fine RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen They didnt quit they wanted his head RA RA RASPUTIN Russias greatest love machine And so they shot him till he was dead Oh those Russians

                In my rearview mirror My life is getting clearer The sunset sighs and slowly disappears Trinkets once were treasure Life changes like the weather You grow up grow old or hit the road Round here So I drive watching white lines passing by With my plastic dashboard Jesus Waiting there to greet us Hey hey I finally found my way Say goodbye to yesterday Hit the gas there aint no brakes On the lost highway Yeah Im busting loose Im letting go out on this open road Its independence day on this lost highway Hey hey hey hey I dont know where Im going But I know where Ive been Now Im afraid of going back again So I drive years and miles are flying by And waiting there to great us Is my plastic dashboard Jesus Hey hey I finally found my way Say goodbye to yesterday Hit the gas there aint no brakes On the lost highway Yeah Im busting loose Im letting go out on this open road Its independence day on this lost highway Hey hey hey hey Oh patron saint of lonely souls To tell this boy which way to go Guide the car you got the keys Farewell to mediocrity Kicking off the cruise control And turning up the radio Got just enough religion And a half tank of gas come on Lets go I finally found my way Say goodbye to yesterday Hit the gas there aint no brakes On the lost highway Im busting loose Im letting go Out on this open road Its independence day on this lost highway Hey hey hey hey Hey hey on the lost highway
