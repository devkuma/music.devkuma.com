<p>I was a machine<br>
it was my choice<br>
No love<br>
in my pockets<br>
Stick to the plan<br>
for the cash<br>
I used to be built<br>
this way<br>
Only businessman<br>
can survive<br>
In this dxxx system<br>
what the heck<br>
I didn&rsquo;t care<br>
before I met you<br>
You make a crack<br>
in my brain<br>
You make me feel<br>
the earthquake<br>
You make<br>
the movie effects<br>
Around you<br>
is that a new tech?<br>
My heart is<br>
just pumping<br>
In the mirror<br>
there&rsquo;s a puppy<br>
Did you just cast<br>
a magic spell on me?<br>
The Bible<br>
says<br>
The love is<br>
the greatest<br>
Finally I added<br>
the love system<br>
I feel like you<br>
you feel like me<br>
Maybe we&rsquo;re connected<br>
by this system<br>
All the senses<br>
that I forgot<br>
I just turned on<br>
thru my whole body<br>
Are you a sorceress<br>
are you an angel?<br>
Now I&rsquo;m confused<br>
but don&rsquo;t speak out<br>
Your magic makes me<br>
forget<br>
What I&rsquo;m going through<br>
it doesn&rsquo;t matter<br>
I&rsquo;m happy<br>
though I&rsquo;m lost<br>
I&rsquo;m not<br>
curious<br>
About the reason<br>
of this feeling<br>
I do not get it quite<br>
with my knowledge<br>
But<br>
don&rsquo;t tell me<br>
How<br>
beautiful<br>
All the rocks are<br>
like magic<br>
How<br>
wonderful<br>
All the creatures are<br>
like magic<br>
I didn&rsquo;t<br>
realize<br>
That I&rsquo;m living<br>
in this blessing<br>
But you opened my mind<br>
I can feel your magic<br>
How<br>
beautiful<br>
All the rocks are<br>
like magic<br>
How<br>
wonderful<br>
All the creatures are<br>
like magic<br>
I didn&rsquo;t<br>
realize<br>
That I&rsquo;m living<br>
in this blessing<br>
But you opened my mind<br>
I can feel your magic<br>
I didn&rsquo;t see<br>
the future<br>
But<br>
now I can imagine it<br>
I didn&rsquo;t feel<br>
the love<br>
But now I do<br>
it&rsquo;s magic<br>
Where are you<br>
going&rsquo;<br>
Stay here with me<br>
all night<br>
You need to teach me<br>
more<br>
About<br>
your magical world<br>
How can I ignore it<br>
I can&rsquo;t remove it<br>
From my head since<br>
I&rsquo;ve experienced you<br>
24/7<br>
all day<br>
High enough<br>
from your atmosphere<br>
It&rsquo;s supernatural<br>
I think<br>
There&rsquo;s no expression<br>
to explain your magic<br>
I&rsquo;m just enjoying<br>
your spell<br>
Your magic makes me<br>
forget<br>
What I&rsquo;m going through<br>
it doesn&rsquo;t matter<br>
I&rsquo;m happy<br>
though I&rsquo;m lost<br>
I&rsquo;m not<br>
curious<br>
About the reason<br>
of this feeling<br>
I do not get it quite<br>
with my knowledge<br>
But<br>
don&rsquo;t tell me<br>
How<br>
beautiful<br>
All the rocks are<br>
like magic<br>
How<br>
wonderful<br>
All the creatures are<br>
like magic<br>
I didn&rsquo;t<br>
realize<br>
That I&rsquo;m living<br>
in this blessing<br>
But you opened my mind<br>
I can feel your magic<br>
How<br>
beautiful<br>
All the rocks are<br>
like magic<br>
How<br>
wonderful<br>
All the creatures are<br>
like magic<br>
I didn&rsquo;t<br>
realize<br>
That I&rsquo;m living<br>
in this blessing<br>
But you opened my mind<br>
I can feel your magic<br>
I didn&rsquo;t see<br>
the future<br>
But now I can<br>
imagine it<br>
I didn&rsquo;t feel<br>
the love<br>
But now I do<br>
it&rsquo;s magic<br>
Your love is magic<br>
your love is amazing<br>
Your love is magic<br>
your love is amazing<br>
Your love is magic<br>
your love is amazing<br>
Your love is magic<br>
your love is amazing<br>
You turned<br>
on my vision<br>
Now look we&rsquo;re under<br>
the rainbow sky<br>
You just turned off<br>
my fan<br>
Finally I know<br>
what is the love<br>
How<br>
beautiful<br>
All the rocks are<br>
like magic</p>
