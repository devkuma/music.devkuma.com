<p>Cigars<br>
in the summer time<br>
Under the sky<br>
by the light<br>
I can feel<br>
your read my mind<br>
I can see it<br>
in your eyes<br>
Under the moon<br>
as it plays<br>
Like music<br>
every line<br>
There&rsquo;s a rug<br>
with a bleeding dye<br>
Under the fan<br>
in the room<br>
Where the passions<br>
burning high<br>
By the chair<br>
with the leopard skin<br>
Under the light<br>
it&rsquo;s always<br>
Penny and me tonight<br>
saying oh oh yeah<br>
On the plane step<br>
with both my feet<br>
Riding in seat<br>
number three<br>
On a flight to N Y C<br>
got my bean<br>
In a coffee cup<br>
next to my seat<br>
Catch the view and<br>
another good book<br>
To read<br>
sitting at home<br>
Or the friendly skies<br>
missing her eyes<br>
It&rsquo;s always<br>
Penny and me tonight<br>
&lsquo;Cause Penny and me<br>
like to roll<br>
The windows down<br>
turn the radio up<br>
Push the pedal<br>
to the ground<br>
And penny and me<br>
like to gaze<br>
At starry skies<br>
close our eyes<br>
Pretend to fly<br>
it&rsquo;s always<br>
Penny and me tonight<br>
saying oh oh no no no<br>
Staring at<br>
a million city lights<br>
But still Penny and I<br>
are all alone<br>
Beneath the sky<br>
feel the wind<br>
Brushing slowly by<br>
if I could soar<br>
I would try<br>
to take these wings<br>
And fly away to where<br>
the leaves turn red<br>
But no matter<br>
where I am instead<br>
Singing along<br>
to feeling alright<br>
Or making it by<br>
under pink moonlight<br>
It&rsquo;s always<br>
Penny and me tonight<br>
&lsquo;Cause Penny and me<br>
like to roll<br>
The windows down<br>
turn the radio up<br>
Push the pedal<br>
to the ground<br>
And Penny and me<br>
like to gaze<br>
At starry skies<br>
close our eyes<br>
Pretend to fly<br>
saying oh oh<br>
Close our eyes<br>
pretend to fly<br>
It&rsquo;s always<br>
Penny and me tonight<br>
Penny likes<br>
to get away<br>
And drowned her pain<br>
in lemonade<br>
Penny dreams<br>
of rainy days<br>
And nights up late<br>
by the fireplace<br>
And aimless<br>
conversations<br>
About the<br>
better day-</p>
<p>Singing along<br>
feeling alright yeah<br>
Or making it by<br>
under pink moonlight<br>
It&rsquo;s always<br>
Penny and me tonight<br>
&lsquo;Cause Penny and me<br>
like to roll<br>
The windows down<br>
turn the radio up<br>
Push the pedal<br>
to the ground<br>
And Penny and me<br>
like to gaze<br>
At starry skies<br>
close our eyes<br>
Pretend to fly<br>
it&rsquo;s always<br>
Penny and me tonight<br>
saying oh oh<br>
Penny and me tonight<br>
ha ha<br>
Penny and me tonight<br>
ha ha<br>
Just Penny and me<br>
tonight ha ha-</p>
