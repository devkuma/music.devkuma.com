<hr>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t wait for you to come clear the cupboards<br>
But now you&rsquo;re going to leave with nothing but a sign<br>
Another evening I&rsquo;ll be sitting reading in between your lines<br>
Because I miss you all the time</p>
<p>So, get away<br>
Another way to feel what you didn&rsquo;t want yourself to know<br>
And let yourself go<br>
You know you didn&rsquo;t lose your self-control<br>
Let&rsquo;s start at the rainbow<br>
Turn away<br>
Another way to be where you didn&rsquo;t want yourself to go<br>
Let yourself go<br>
Is that a compromise</p>
<p>So what do you wanna do, what&rsquo;s your point-of-view?<br>
There&rsquo;s a party soon, do you wanna go?<br>
A handshake with you, what&rsquo;s your point-of-view?<br>
I&rsquo;m on top of you, I don&rsquo;t wanna go<br>
&lsquo;Cause I really wanna stay at your house<br>
And I hopе this works out<br>
But you know how much you broke me apart<br>
I&rsquo;m done with you, I&rsquo;m ignoring you<br>
I don&rsquo;t wanna know</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m awarе that you were lying in the gutter<br>
&lsquo;Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide<br>
So when you tell me I&rsquo;m the reason I just can&rsquo;t believe the lies<br>
And why do I so want to call you(Call you, call you, call you)</p>
<p>So what do you wanna do, what&rsquo;s your point-of-view?<br>
There&rsquo;s a party soon, do you wanna go?<br>
A handshake with you, what&rsquo;s your point-of-view?<br>
I&rsquo;m on top of you, I don&rsquo;t wanna go<br>
&lsquo;Cause I really wanna stay at your house<br>
And I hope this works out<br>
But you know how much you broke me apart<br>
I&rsquo;m done with you, I&rsquo;m ignoring you<br>
I don&rsquo;t wanna know</p>
<p>You<br>
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh<br>
I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m no-one</p>
<p>So, get away<br>
Another way to feel what you didn&rsquo;t want yourself to know<br>
And let yourself go<br>
You know you didn&rsquo;t lose your self-control<br>
Let&rsquo;s start at the rainbow<br>
Turn away<br>
Another way to be where you didn&rsquo;t want yourself to go<br>
Let yourself go<br>
Is that a compromise</p>
<p>So what do you wanna do, what&rsquo;s your point-of-view<br>
There&rsquo;s a party soon, do you wanna go?<br>
A handshake with you, what&rsquo;s your point-of-view?<br>
I&rsquo;m on top of you, I don&rsquo;t wanna go<br>
&lsquo;Cause I really wanna stay at your house<br>
And I hope this works out<br>
But you know how much you broke me apart<br>
I&rsquo;m done with you, I&rsquo;m ignoring you<br>
I don&rsquo;t wanna know</p>
