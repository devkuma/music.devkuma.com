<p>I wish you could be<br>
where and when I want<br>
Find you in New York<br>
London to Seoul<br>
We&rsquo;ll see<br>
all the cities<br>
Day<br>
and night<br>
You can be the reason<br>
I feel alright<br>
I wanna go higher<br>
to a different galaxy<br>
I&rsquo;m there<br>
come be my pilot<br>
Anywhere we would<br>
find us together<br>
But it&rsquo;s not<br>
the starlighted city<br>
Nor was it the breeze<br>
that got me singing<br>
No other sceneries<br>
had me feeling<br>
It&rsquo;s you<br>
that got me feeling<br>
You can take me<br>
higher<br>
High enough for us<br>
to disappear<br>
Never have<br>
I felt so right before<br>
You and I we&rsquo;re<br>
what I&rsquo;m looking for<br>
You take me<br>
higher<br>
Way past the sky<br>
you shine brighter<br>
Can&rsquo;t be more<br>
mesmerised by your<br>
Eyes like the stars<br>
I fall deeper<br>
You can take me<br>
higher</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not<br>
the starlighted city<br>
Nor was it the breeze<br>
that got me singing<br>
No other sceneries<br>
had me feeling<br>
It&rsquo;s you<br>
that got me feeling<br>
You can take me<br>
higher<br>
High enough for us<br>
to disappear<br>
Never have<br>
I felt so right before<br>
You and I we&rsquo;re<br>
what I&rsquo;m looking for<br>
You take me<br>
higher<br>
Way past the sky<br>
you shine brighter<br>
Can&rsquo;t be more<br>
mesmerised by your<br>
Eyes like the stars<br>
I fall deeper<br>
But it&rsquo;s not<br>
the starlighted city<br>
Nor was it the breeze<br>
that got me singing<br>
No other sceneries<br>
had me feeling<br>
It&rsquo;s you<br>
that got me feeling<br>
No it&rsquo;s not<br>
the starlighted city</p>
