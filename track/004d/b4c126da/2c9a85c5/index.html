    <p>작곡: Sung by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=61583" target="_black">61583</a></p>
<p>Nation to nation<br>
All the world<br>
Must get together<br>
Face the problems<br>
That we see Then<br>
maybe somehow<br>
we can<br>
Work it out<br>
I asked my<br>
neighbor For<br>
a favor<br>
She said later<br>
What has come of<br>
All the people<br>
Have we lost love<br>
Of what it&rsquo;s about<br>
I have to find my<br>
peace cuz No one<br>
seems to let me be<br>
False prophets<br>
cry of doom What<br>
are the possibilities<br>
I told my brother<br>
there&rsquo;ll be problems<br>
Times and<br>
tears for fears<br>
But we must live<br>
each day Like it&rsquo;s<br>
the last Go with<br>
it Go with it<br>
Jam It ain&rsquo;t too<br>
much stuff It ain&rsquo;t<br>
too much It ain&rsquo;t<br>
too much for me to<br>
Jam It ain&rsquo;t It<br>
ain&rsquo;t too much<br>
stuff It<br>
ain&rsquo;t Don&rsquo;t<br>
you It ain&rsquo;t too<br>
much for me to<br>
The world keeps<br>
changing rearranging<br>
minds and<br>
thoughts Predictions<br>
fly of doom the<br>
baby boom has<br>
come of age<br>
We&rsquo;ll work it out<br>
I told my brother<br>
Don&rsquo;t you<br>
ask me For<br>
no favors<br>
I&rsquo;m conditioned<br>
by the system<br>
Don&rsquo;t you<br>
preach to me<br>
Don&rsquo;t<br>
scream and shout<br>
She pray to god to<br>
Buddha Then she<br>
sings a<br>
Talmud song<br>
Confusions<br>
contradict<br>
the self Do we<br>
know right from wrong<br>
I just want you to<br>
recognize<br>
me in<br>
the temple<br>
You can&rsquo;t hurt me<br>
I found peace within<br>
myself Go with<br>
it Go with it<br>
Jam It ain&rsquo;t It<br>
ain&rsquo;t too much stuff<br>
It ain&rsquo;t too much<br>
It ain&rsquo;t too<br>
much for<br>
me to<br>
Jam It ain&rsquo;t It<br>
ain&rsquo;t too much stuff<br>
It ain&rsquo;t Don&rsquo;t<br>

too much<br>
for me to<br>
Jam Aha It ain&rsquo;t<br>

much for<br>
me to ho!</p>
<p>Jam jam Here comes<br>
the man Hot man<br>
The big boy stands<br>
movin&rsquo; up a hand<br>
Makin&rsquo; funky tracks<br>
with my man<br>
Michael Jackson<br>
Smooth criminal<br>
That&rsquo;s the man<br>
Mike&rsquo;s so<br>
relaxed Mingle<br>
