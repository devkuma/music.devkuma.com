    <p>작곡: Sung by / 작사: IERO FRANK, WAY GERARD, BRYAR BOB, WAY MICHAEL, TORO RAY<br>

<p>When I was<br>
a young boy<br>
My father took me<br>
into the city<br>
To see a marching band<br>
he said<br>
&ldquo;Son when you grow up<br>
would you be<br>
The savior<br>
of the broken<br>
The beaten<br>
and the damned?&rdquo;<br>
He said<br>
&ldquo;will you defeat them<br>
Your demons and<br>
all the non-believers<br>
The plans<br>
that they have made?<br>
Because one day<br>
I&rsquo;ll leave you<br>
A phantom to lead you<br>
in the summer<br>
To join<br>
the black parade&rdquo;<br>
When I was<br>
a young boy<br>
My father took me<br>
into the city<br>
To see a marching band<br>
he said<br>
&ldquo;Son when you grow up<br>
would you be<br>
The savior<br>
of the broken<br>
The beaten<br>
and the damned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes I get<br>
the feeling<br>
She&rsquo;s watching over me<br>
and other times<br>
I feel<br>
like I should go<br>
And through it<br>
all the rise and fall<br>
The bodies<br>
in the streets<br>
And when you&rsquo;re gone<br>
we want you<br>
All to know<br>
we&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
We&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
and though you&rsquo;re dead<br>
And gone believe me<br>
your memory will<br>
Carry on<br>
we&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
And in my heart<br>
I can&rsquo;t contain it<br>
The anthem won&rsquo;t<br>
explain it<br>
A world that sends<br>
you reeling<br>
From decimated dreams<br>
your misery<br>
And hate will<br>
kill us all<br>
So paint it black<br>
and take it back<br>
Let&rsquo;s shout it loud<br>
and clear<br>
Defiant<br>
to the end<br>
We hear the call<br>
to carry on<br>
We&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
and though you&rsquo;re dead<br>
And gone believe me<br>
your memory will<br>
Carry on<br>
we&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
And though<br>
you&rsquo;re broken<br>
And defeated you&rsquo;re<br>
weary widow marches<br>
On and on we carry<br>
through the fears<br>
Oh oh oh<br>
disappointed<br>
Faces of<br>
your peers<br>
Oh oh oh oh<br>
take a look at me<br>
&lsquo;Cause I could not<br>
care at all<br>
Do or die<br>
you&rsquo;ll never make me<br>
Because the world will<br>
never take my heart<br>
Go and try<br>
you&rsquo;ll never break me<br>
We want it all we<br>
wanna play this part<br>
I won&rsquo;t explain<br>
or say I&rsquo;m sorry<br>
I&rsquo;m unashamed<br>
I&rsquo;m gonna show my scar<br>
Give a cheer<br>
for all the broken<br>
Listen here because<br>
it&rsquo;s who we are<br>
I&rsquo;m just a man<br>
I&rsquo;m not a hero<br>
Just a boy who had<br>
to sing his song<br>
I&rsquo;m just a man<br>
I&rsquo;m not a hero<br>
I! don&rsquo;t! care!<br>
we&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
We&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
and though you&rsquo;re dead<br>
And gone believe me<br>
your memory will<br>
Carry on<br>
we&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
And though<br>
you&rsquo;re broken<br>
And defeated you&rsquo;re<br>
weary widow marches on<br>
We&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
we&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
We&rsquo;ll carry on<br>
we&rsquo;ll carry<br>
We&rsquo;ll<br>
carry on</p>
