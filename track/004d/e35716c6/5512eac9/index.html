    <p>[Verse 1: Mac Miller]<br>
Yeah, I think I&rsquo;m stuck<br>
inside nostalgia<br>
My mind are in the times<br>
when this love was so divine<br>
But now it&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo; like without ya<br>
Feelin&rsquo; like how the fuck did<br>
We get into a place<br>
we ain&rsquo;t accustomed<br>
to lovin&rsquo; inside of<br>
I know I&rsquo;m out of my mind<br>
more often than not<br>
You know I&rsquo;m used to givin&rsquo;<br>
this all that I got, yeah<br>
It&rsquo;s not a waste when that smile<br>
on your face<br>
You tell me you outta place,<br>
you parked in my spot<br>
Okay, baby this a piece of cake<br>
We could lay up on the beach,<br>
you could feed me grapes<br>
It’s my favorite song, spin it<br>
‘til the needle breaks<br>
We could quit the whole game,<br>
do the real estate thing<br>
It&rsquo;s how you beat the case<br>
Put in work, turn that pussy<br>
to the office<br>
Be on top of your game,<br>
this here a goddess<br>
Now I ain&rsquo;t here<br>
to break a promise<br>
I&rsquo;m just tryna keep it honest,<br>
and honestly</p>
<p>[Hook: Njomza]<br>
Tell the truth, tell the truth,<br>
tell truth<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
Show me you, show me you,<br>
show me you<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
Tell the truth, tell the truth,<br>
tell the truth<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
Show me you, show me you,<br>
show me you<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na</p>
<p>[Verse 2: Mac Miller]<br>
Okay, no mishaps, this,<br>
that, and the third<br>
Don&rsquo;t go back on my word,<br>
yeah I keep that shit gift wrapped<br>
Your pussy a ride better<br>
than Six Flags, I&rsquo;m in that<br>
No take aways, no give backs<br>
No question,<br>
we&rsquo;ve been through adolesence<br>
And change of direction,<br>
yeah I paid attention to it<br>
It&rsquo;s never been easy<br>
but now it&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; ruthless<br>
A little more pain,<br>
that&rsquo;s just better music<br>
Girl what&rsquo;s on your brain?<br>
Cause that head is stupid<br>
Lotta people suck a dick,<br>
but you can execute it<br>
Perfect timing,<br>
don&rsquo;t you add another second to it<br>
Don&rsquo;t you ever-ever-ever-<br>
ever-ever do it<br>
Yeah, head pollution,<br>
conflict resolution<br>
Keep it true, everything<br>
that I do with you<br>
I ain&rsquo;t here to break a promise<br>
I&rsquo;m just tryna keep it honest,<br>
and honestly</p>
<p>[Hook: Njomza]<br>
Tell the truth, tell the truth,<br>
tell truth<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
Show me you, show me you,<br>
show me you<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
Tell the truth, tell the truth,<br>
tell the truth<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
Show me you, show me you,<br>
show me you<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na</p>
<p>[Outro: Njomza &amp; Mac Miller]<br>
You don&rsquo;t have to protect me<br>
We both know how it ends<br>
I just need your presence<br>
Wanna feel you feel me<br>
You just landed from<br>
the Planet God Damn, damn<br>
Wanna feel you feel me<br>
Wanna feel you feel me<br>
You just landed from<br>
the Planet God Damn, damn<br>
Wanna feel you feel me<br>
Wanna feel you feel me</p>
