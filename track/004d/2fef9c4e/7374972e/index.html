<p>I&rsquo;m a malancholy man<br>
that&rsquo;s what I am<br>
All the world<br>
surrounds me<br>
And my feet are<br>
on the ground<br>
I&rsquo;m a very lonely man<br>
doing what I can<br>
All the world<br>
astounds me<br>
And I think<br>
I understand<br>
That we&rsquo;re going to<br>
keep growing<br>
Wait and see<br>
when all the stars<br>
Are falling down<br>
into the sea<br>
And on the ground<br>
and angry voices<br>
Carry on the wind<br>
a beam of light will<br>
Fill your head<br>
and you&rsquo;ll remember<br>
What&rsquo;s been said<br>
by all the good man<br>
This world&rsquo;s<br>
ever known<br>
Another man is<br>
what you&rsquo;ll see<br>
Who looks like you<br>
and looks like me<br>
And yet somehow<br>
he will not<br>
Feel the same<br>
his life caught up<br>
In misery<br>
he doesn&rsquo;t think<br>
Like you and me<br>
&lsquo;cause he can&rsquo;t see<br>
What you<br>
and I can see-</p>
<p>When all the stars<br>
are falling down<br>
Into the sea<br>
and on the ground<br>
And angry voices<br>
carry on the wind<br>
A beam of light will<br>
fill you head<br>
And you&rsquo;ll remember<br>
what&rsquo;s been said<br>
By all the good man<br>
this world&rsquo;s<br>
Ever know<br>
another man is<br>
What you&rsquo;ll see<br>
who looks like you<br>
And looks like me<br>
and yet somehow<br>
He will not<br>
feel the same<br>
His life caught up<br>
in misery<br>
He doesn&rsquo;t think<br>
like you and me<br>
&lsquo;Cause he can&rsquo;t see<br>
what you<br>
And I can see<br>
I&rsquo;m a melancholy man<br>
That&rsquo;s what I am<br>
all the world<br>
Surrounds me<br>
and my feed are<br>
On the ground<br>
I&rsquo;m a very lonely man<br>
Doing what I can<br>
all the world<br>
Astounds me<br>
and I think<br>
I understand<br>
that we&rsquo;re going to<br>
Keep growing<br>
wait and see<br>
I&rsquo;m a melancholy man<br>
that&rsquo;s what I am<br>
All the world<br>
surrounds me<br>
I&rsquo;m a very lonely man<br>
doing what I can<br>
All the world<br>
astounds me<br>
And I think<br>
I understand<br>
That we&rsquo;re going to<br>
keep growing<br>
Wait and see<br>
woo woo<br>
I&rsquo;m<br>
a melancholy man-</p>
