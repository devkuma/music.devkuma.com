<p>Every second every day<br>
I spend hoping<br>
We never change<br>
love when you<br>
Never wait or hesitate<br>
to tell me<br>
What is on your mind<br>
really do<br>
Enjoy<br>
your company<br>
I think<br>
you would agree<br>
Just where you&rsquo;d<br>
rather be is<br>
Right here<br>
with me<br>
Make my day<br>
in every way<br>
Know I&rsquo;ll be okay<br>
when you are around<br>
I just want<br>
to stop<br>
Worrying &lsquo;bout<br>
what could come<br>
I really like it here<br>
in your arms<br>
Thinking this is<br>
where I belong<br>
I had no doubt<br>
in my mind<br>
We would<br>
make it far<br>
Now I fear a change<br>
want time to stop<br>
Waiting<br>
for an argument<br>
Inevitable<br>
but don&rsquo;t know how bad<br>
The smallest things<br>
will get to you<br>
Hoping we won&rsquo;t<br>
be a thing of the past<br>
But<br>
where we are<br>
Today is<br>
where I wanna stay<br>
Leave worries<br>
far away<br>
When you&rsquo;re here<br>
with me<br>
I should just<br>
enjoy this time<br>
In case<br>
we end up<br>
Leaving all<br>
this behind<br>
I just need<br>
to stop<br>
Worrying &lsquo;bout<br>
what could come<br>
I really like it here<br>
in your arms<br>
Thinking this is<br>
where I belong<br>
I had no doubt<br>
in my mind<br>
We would<br>
make it far<br>
Now I fear a change<br>
want time to stop<br>
(Yeah I&rsquo;m always<br>
with you)<br>
I wanna remember<br>
this moment in time<br>
(Though I&rsquo;m always<br>
with you)<br>
I wanna remember if we<br>
leave this behind<br>
I really like it here<br>
in your arms<br>
Thinking this is<br>
where I belong<br>
I had no doubt<br>
in my mind<br>
We would<br>
make it far<br>
Now I fear a change<br>
want time to stop<br>
I really like it here<br>
in your arms<br>
Thinking this is<br>
where I belong<br>
I had no doubt<br>
in my mind<br>
We would<br>
make it far<br>
Now I fear a change<br>
want time to stop<br>
(Yeah I&rsquo;m always<br>
with you)<br>
I wanna remember<br>
this moment in time<br>
(Though I&rsquo;m always<br>
with you)<br>
I wanna remember if we<br>
leave this behind<br>
(Yeah I&rsquo;m always<br>
with you)<br>
I wanna remember<br>
this moment in time<br>
(Though I&rsquo;m always<br>
with you)<br>
I wanna remember if we<br>
leave this behind</p>
