<p>Well you stole<br>
my heart<br>
And I&rsquo;ll get it back<br>
but look me<br>
In the eye babe<br>
tell me why<br>
You gonna love me<br>
like that<br>
Why you gonna love me<br>
like that ooh ohh<br>
Well I&rsquo;ve walked<br>
this world<br>
Five times or more<br>
and after all<br>
This walking babe<br>
you got me<br>
Crawlin on the floor<br>
crawlin on the floor<br>
And I know this world<br>
keeps on turning<br>
Keeps me yearning<br>
how can you<br>
Turn and walk away<br>
pretending<br>
Everythings okay<br>
how can you turn<br>
You back<br>
tell me why<br>
You gonna love me<br>
like that<br>
Why you gonna love me<br>
like that ooh ohh<br>
Well I thought<br>
you&rsquo;d listen<br>
But I&rsquo;m shattered<br>
like broken glass<br>
Well I thought<br>
that we&rsquo;d be<br>
Different babe<br>
yea I thought that<br>
We would last<br>
I thought that<br>
We would last<br>
and I know<br>
This world<br>
keeps on spinning<br>
Every minute that<br>
your in it<br>
How can you turn<br>
and walk away<br>
Pretending<br>
everythings okay<br>
How can you turn<br>
you back<br>
Tell me why<br>
you gonna love me<br>
Like that<br>
why you gonna love me<br>
Like that ooh ohh<br>
love me or<br>
Leave me baby<br>
but dont lead me on<br>
With loving<br>
like yours<br>
Believe me<br>
I&rsquo;m better off<br>
I&rsquo;m better off<br>
alone ooh ohh<br>
Well I was your gypsy<br>
throwing diamonds<br>
At your feet<br>
drifted &lsquo;round<br>
You like a satellite<br>
gave you<br>
Everything you need<br>
everything you need<br>
And I know<br>
this world<br>
Keeps on turning<br>
keeps me yearnin<br>
And yearnin<br>
how can you turn<br>
And walk away<br>
pretending<br>
Everythings okay<br>
how can you turn<br>
You back<br>
tell me why<br>
You gonna love me<br>
like that<br>
Why you gonna love me<br>
like that oh<br>
How can you<br>
just break away<br>
Why can&rsquo;t you find<br>
the words to say<br>
Love is something<br>
you work at<br>
Tell me why<br>
you gonna love me<br>
Like that<br>
why you gonna<br>
Love me like that<br>
why you gonna<br>
Love me like that oh<br>
how can you<br>
Throw us away<br>
look at what<br>
You lost today<br>
now everything<br>
In shades<br>
of gray and<br>
Now your<br>
pushing me away<br>
Say all the things<br>
you need to say<br>
Thought we were<br>
going all the way<br>
Play all the games<br>
you what to play<br>
Slowly we just<br>
fade away-</p>
