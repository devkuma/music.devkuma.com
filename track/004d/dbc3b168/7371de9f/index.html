<p>Am I out of my head<br>
am I out of my mind<br>
If you only knew<br>
the bad things I like<br>
Don&rsquo;t think that I can<br>
explain it<br>
What can I say<br>
it&rsquo;s complicated<br>
Don&rsquo;t matter<br>
what you say<br>
Don&rsquo;t matter<br>
what you do<br>
I only wanna do<br>
bad things to you<br>
So good that you can&rsquo;t<br>
explain it<br>
What can I say<br>
it&rsquo;s complicated<br>
Nothing&rsquo;s that bad<br>
if it feels good<br>
So you come back<br>
like I knew you would<br>
And we&rsquo;re both wild<br>
and the night&rsquo;s young<br>
And you&rsquo;re<br>
my drug<br>
Breathe you in<br>
&rsquo;til my face numb<br>
Drop it down<br>
to that bass drum<br>
I got<br>
what you dream about<br>
Nails scratchin&rsquo;<br>
my back tatt<br>
Eyes closed<br>
while you scream out<br>
And you keep me in<br>
with those hips<br>
While my teeth<br>
sink in those lips<br>
While your body&rsquo;s<br>
givin&rsquo; me life<br>
And you suffocate<br>
in my kiss<br>
Then<br>
you said<br>
I want you<br>
forever<br>
Even when we&rsquo;re<br>
not together<br>
Scars<br>
on my body<br>
So I can take you<br>
wherever<br>
Like I want you<br>
forever<br>
Even when we&rsquo;re<br>
not together<br>
Scars<br>
on my body<br>
I can look at you<br>
whenever<br>
Am I out of my head<br>
am I out of my mind<br>
If you only knew<br>
the bad things I like<br>
Don&rsquo;t think that I can<br>
explain it<br>
What can I say<br>
it&rsquo;s complicated<br>
Don&rsquo;t matter<br>
what you say<br>
Don&rsquo;t matter<br>
what you do<br>
I only wanna do<br>
bad things to you<br>
So good that you can&rsquo;t<br>
explain it<br>
What can I say<br>
it&rsquo;s complicated<br>
I can&rsquo;t explain it<br>
I love the pain<br>
And I love the way<br>
that your breath<br>
Numbs me like novocain<br>
and we are<br>
Always high<br>
keep it strange<br>
OK yeah I&rsquo;m insane<br>
but you the same<br>
Let me<br>
paint the picture<br>
Couch<br>
by the kitchen<br>
Nothin&rsquo;<br>
but your heels on<br>
Losin&rsquo;<br>
our religion<br>
You&rsquo;re my pretty<br>
little vixen<br>
And I&rsquo;m that voice<br>
inside your head<br>
That keeps tellin&rsquo; you<br>
to listen<br>
To all the bad things<br>
I say and you said<br>
I want you<br>
forever<br>
Even when we&rsquo;re<br>
not together<br>
Scars<br>
on my body<br>
So I can take you<br>
wherever<br>
Like I want you<br>
forever<br>
Even when we&rsquo;re<br>
not together<br>
Scars<br>
on my body<br>
I can look at you<br>
whenever<br>
Am I out of my head<br>
am I out of my mind<br>
If you only knew<br>
the bad things I like<br>
Don&rsquo;t think that I can<br>
explain it<br>
What can I say<br>
it&rsquo;s complicated<br>
Don&rsquo;t matter<br>
what you say<br>
Don&rsquo;t matter<br>
what you do<br>
I only wanna do<br>
bad things to you<br>
So good that you can&rsquo;t<br>
explain it<br>
What can I say<br>
it&rsquo;s complicated<br>
The way we love is<br>
so unique<br>
And when we touch<br>
I&rsquo;m shivering<br>
And no one has<br>
to get it<br>
Just you and me<br>
(right)<br>
&lsquo;Cause we&rsquo;re<br>
just livin&rsquo;<br>
Between the sheets<br>
(you said)<br>
I want you<br>
forever<br>
Even when we&rsquo;re<br>
not together<br>
Scars<br>
on my body<br>
So I can take you<br>
wherever<br>
Like I want you<br>
forever<br>
Even when we&rsquo;re<br>
not together<br>
Scars<br>
on my body<br>
I can look at you<br>
whenever<br>
Am I out of my head<br>
am I out of my mind<br>
If you only knew<br>
the bad things I like<br>
Don&rsquo;t think that I can<br>
explain it<br>
What can I say<br>
it&rsquo;s complicated<br>
Don&rsquo;t matter<br>
what you say<br>
Don&rsquo;t matter<br>
what you do<br>
I only wanna do<br>
bad things to you<br>
So good that you can&rsquo;t<br>
explain it<br>
What can I say<br>
it&rsquo;s complicated</p>
