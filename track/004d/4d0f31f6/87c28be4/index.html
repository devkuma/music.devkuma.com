    <p>작곡: Robert Lopez, Kristen&hellip; / 작사: Words &amp; Music by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79362" target="_black">79362</a></p>
<p>(What&rsquo;s the issue<br>
dear?<br>
Why are you holding<br>
back from such a man?)<br>
Is it the clumpy way<br>
he walks?<br>
Or the grumpy way<br>
he talks?<br>
Or the pear-shaped<br>
square-shaped<br>
Weirdness<br>
of his feet?<br>
And though we know<br>
he washes well<br>
He always ends up<br>
sorta smelly<br>
But you&rsquo;ll never<br>
meet a fella<br>
Who&rsquo;s as sensitive<br>
and sweet<br>
So he&rsquo;s a bit<br>
of a fixer upper<br>
So he&rsquo;s got<br>
a few flaws<br>
Like his peculiar<br>
brain dear<br>
His thing<br>
with the reindeer<br>
That&rsquo;s<br>
a little<br>
Outside<br>
of nature&rsquo;s laws<br>
So he&rsquo;s a bit<br>
of a fixer upper<br>
But this<br>
we&rsquo;re certain of<br>
You can fix this<br>
fixer upper up<br>
With a little bit<br>
of love<br>
(Can we please<br>
just stop<br>
Talking<br>
about this?<br>
We&rsquo;ve got a real<br>
actual problem here<br>
I&rsquo;ll say<br>
so tell me dear)<br>
Is it the way<br>
that he runs scared?<br>
Or that he&rsquo;s<br>
socially impaired?<br>
Or that he only likes<br>
to tinkle<br>
In the woods?<br>
(what?)<br>
Are you holding back<br>
your fondness<br>
Due to his unmanly<br>
blondeness?<br>
Or the way<br>
he covers up<br>
That he&rsquo;s<br>
the honest goods?<br>
He&rsquo;s just a bit<br>
of a fixer upper<br>
He&rsquo;s got<br>
a couple of bugs<br>
His isolation is<br>
confirmation<br>
Of his desperation<br>
for healing hugs<br>
So he&rsquo;s a bit<br>
of a fixer upper<br>
But we know<br>
what to do<br>
The way to fix up<br>
this fixer upper<br>
Is to fix him up<br>
with you<br>
(Enough<br>
she is engaged<br>
To someone else<br>
okay?)<br>
So she&rsquo;s a bit<br>
of a fixer upper<br>
That&rsquo;s<br>
a minor thing<br>
Her quote engagement<br>
is a flex arrangement<br>
And by the way<br>
I don&rsquo;t see no ring<br>
So she&rsquo;s a bit<br>
of a fixer upper<br>
Her brain&rsquo;s<br>
a bit betwixt<br>
Get the fiance<br>
out of the way<br>
And the whole thing<br>
will be fixed<br>
We&rsquo;re not saying<br>
you can change him<br>
&lsquo;Cause people don&rsquo;t<br>
really change<br>
We&rsquo;re only saying<br>
that love&rsquo;s a force<br>
That&rsquo;s powerful<br>
and strange<br>
People make<br>
bad choices<br>
If they&rsquo;re mad<br>
or scared or stressed<br>
But throw a little<br>
love their way<br>
And you&rsquo;ll bring out<br>
their best<br>
True love brings out<br>
the best<br>
Everyone&rsquo;s a bit<br>
of a fixer upper<br>
That&rsquo;s what<br>
it&rsquo;s all about<br>
(Father<br>
sister brother)<br>
We need<br>
each other<br>
To raise us up<br>
and round us out<br>
Everyone&rsquo;s a bit<br>
of a fixer upper<br>
But when push<br>
comes to shove<br>
The only<br>
fixer upper<br>
Fixer that can<br>
fix a fixer upper is<br>
True true<br>
true true true<br>
Love<br>
true love<br>
Love love<br>
love love love<br>
Love<br>
true love<br>
True(do you Anna<br>
take Kristoff<br>
To be your<br>
trollfully wedded<br>
Wait<br>
what?<br>
You&rsquo;re getting<br>
married)love</p>
