<p>I asked her<br>
to stay<br>
But she<br>
wouldn&rsquo;t listen<br>
She left before I had<br>
the chance to say oh<br>
The words<br>
that would mend<br>
The things that<br>
were broken<br>
But now it&rsquo;s far too<br>
late she&rsquo;s gone away<br>
Every night you cry<br>
yourself to sleep<br>
Thinking &ldquo;why does<br>
this happen to me?<br>
Why does every moment<br>
have to be so hard?&rdquo;<br>
Hard to<br>
believe that<br>
It&rsquo;s not<br>
over tonight<br>
Just give me<br>
one more<br>
Chance to<br>
make it right<br>
I may not make it<br>
through the night<br>
I won&rsquo;t go home<br>
without you<br>
The taste<br>
of her breath<br>
I&rsquo;ll never<br>
get over<br>
And the noises that<br>
she made kept me awake<br>
Oh the weight<br>
of the things<br>
That remain<br>
unspoken<br>
Built up so much<br>
it crushed us everyday<br>
Every night you cry<br>
yourself to sleep<br>
Thinking &ldquo;why does<br>
this happen to me?<br>
Why does every moment<br>
have to be so hard?&rdquo;<br>
Hard to<br>
believe that<br>
It&rsquo;s not<br>
over tonight<br>
Just give me<br>
one more<br>
Chance to<br>
make it right<br>
I may not make it<br>
through the night<br>
I won&rsquo;t go home<br>
without you oh<br>
It&rsquo;s not<br>
over tonight<br>
Just give me<br>
one more<br>
Chance to<br>
make it right<br>
I may not make it<br>
through the night<br>
I won&rsquo;t go home<br>
without you oh<br>
Of all the<br>
things I felt<br>
I&rsquo;ve never<br>
really showed<br>
Perhaps the worst is<br>
that I ever let you go<br>
Should not ever<br>
let you go oh oh oh<br>
It&rsquo;s not<br>
over tonight<br>
Just give me<br>
one more<br>
Chance to<br>
make it right<br>
I may not make it<br>
through the night<br>
I won&rsquo;t go home<br>
without you oh<br>
It&rsquo;s not<br>
over tonight<br>
Just give me<br>
one more<br>
Chance to<br>
make it right<br>
I may not make it<br>
through the night<br>
I won&rsquo;t go home<br>
without you<br>
And I won&rsquo;t go home<br>
without you<br>
And I won&rsquo;t go home<br>
without you<br>
And I won&rsquo;t go home<br>
without you</p>
