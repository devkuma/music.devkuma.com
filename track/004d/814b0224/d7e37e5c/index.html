    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=60688" target="_black">60688</a></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re everywhere<br>
I walk<br>
I don&rsquo;t remember<br>
if I smiled<br>
I don&rsquo;t think<br>
we talked<br>
But you always<br>
hung around a while<br>
And I don&rsquo;t know<br>
your name<br>
Yeah I think<br>
that you were tall<br>
I don&rsquo;t<br>
remember if<br>
I was ever nice to you<br>
at all<br>
Suddenly<br>
you come undone<br>
You tell me<br>
I&rsquo;m the only one<br>
You hold my head up<br>
with a gun<br>
And tell me<br>
that we are in love<br>
You touch me<br>
and you want the same<br>
I close my eyes<br>
and start to pray<br>
And tell you<br>
I will be the way<br>
You want if you will<br>
only say your name<br>
You wrote me<br>
everyday<br>
I never knew<br>
that it was you<br>
I just threw it<br>
all away<br>
I didn&rsquo;t know<br>
what else to do<br>
Jesus told you<br>
to find me<br>
And never ever<br>
let me go<br>
And we would<br>
be so happy<br>
He promised you<br>
that I would know<br>
Suddenly<br>
you come undone<br>
You tell me<br>
I&rsquo;m the only one<br>
You hold my head up<br>
with a gun<br>
And tell me<br>
that we are in love<br>
You touch me<br>
and you want the same<br>
I close my eyes<br>
and start to pray<br>
And tell you<br>
I will be the way<br>
You want if you will<br>
only say your name<br>
Your<br>
name<br>
I am sorry<br>
so sorry oh<br>
I am sorry Jesus<br>
forgot to tell me</p>
<p>I see<br>
that you are crying<br>
I know you only meant<br>
to be with me<br>
Maybe I was hasty<br>
I should<br>
Have listened<br>
more carefully<br>
Please tell me<br>
it&rsquo;s not too late<br>
Your decision<br>
has been made<br>
Before<br>
you pull the trigger<br>
Please won&rsquo;t you<br>
tell me your name?<br>
Oh<br>
your name<br>
Suddenly<br>
you come undone<br>
You tell me<br>
I&rsquo;m the only one<br>
You hold my head up<br>
with a gun<br>
And tell me<br>
that we are in love<br>
You touch me<br>
and you want the same<br>
I close my eyes<br>
and start to pray<br>
And tell you<br>
I will be the way<br>
You want if you will<br>
only say your name</p>
