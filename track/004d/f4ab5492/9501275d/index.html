<p>You kept me as<br>
your favourite secret<br>
And I thought<br>
we just took it slow<br>
They said<br>
your girlfriend&rsquo;s<br>
From<br>
the beaches<br>
It&rsquo;s funny how<br>
everybody but me knows<br>
I feel<br>
like you<br>
Feel nothing<br>
that&rsquo;s fine<br>
Please<br>
leave this behind<br>
You&rsquo;re losing<br>
your mind<br>
Calling me<br>
a hundred times<br>
Time<br>
you drew a line<br>
And stopped<br>
wasting mine<br>
Miss me?<br>
that&rsquo;s a lie-ie-ie<br>
Now that<br>
I&rsquo;m over that hill<br>
You wanna say<br>
how you feel<br>
Crazy to think<br>
that<br>
You still call me<br>
psycho<br>
You wanna talk?<br>
not ideal<br>
Heard I moved on?<br>
babe that&rsquo;s real<br>
And<br>
you&rsquo;ve got a girl<br>
But you still call me<br>
psycho<br>
Now that<br>
I&rsquo;m over that hill<br>
You wanna say<br>
how you feel<br>
Crazy to think<br>
that<br>
You still call me<br>
psycho<br>
You wanna talk?<br>
not ideal<br>
Heard I moved on?<br>
babe that&rsquo;s real<br>
And<br>
you&rsquo;ve got a girl<br>
But you still call me<br>
psycho<br>
Playing a perfect<br>
Patrick Bateman<br>
Put blame on anyone<br>
but you<br>
All kinds<br>
of ghosts down<br>
In your basement<br>
you made me<br>
Feel so useful<br>
then so used<br>
I feel<br>
like you<br>
Feel nothing<br>
that&rsquo;s fine<br>
Please<br>
leave this behind<br>
You&rsquo;re losing<br>
your mind<br>
Calling me<br>
a hundred times<br>
Time<br>
you drew a line<br>
And stopped<br>
wasting mine<br>
Miss me?<br>
that&rsquo;s a lie-ie-ie<br>
Now that<br>
I&rsquo;m over that hill<br>
You wanna say<br>
how you feel<br>
Crazy to think<br>
that<br>
You still call me<br>
psycho<br>
You wanna talk?<br>
not ideal<br>
Heard I moved on?<br>
babe that&rsquo;s real<br>
And<br>
you&rsquo;ve got a girl<br>
But you still call me<br>
psycho<br>
Now that<br>
I&rsquo;m over that hill<br>
You wanna say<br>
how you feel<br>
Crazy to think<br>
that<br>
You still call me<br>
psycho<br>
You wanna talk?<br>
not ideal<br>
Heard I moved on?<br>
babe that&rsquo;s real<br>
And<br>
you&rsquo;ve got a girl<br>
But you still call me<br>
psycho<br>
You don&rsquo;t want me<br>
at all<br>
But you don&rsquo;t want me<br>
to fall for anyone<br>
But you&rsquo;ll go<br>
with anyone<br>
And you still call me<br>
psycho<br>
You don&rsquo;t want me<br>
at all<br>
But you don&rsquo;t want me<br>
to fall for anyone<br>
When all is said<br>
and done<br>
You still call me<br>
psycho<br>
All your exes found me<br>
and so beware<br>
We&rsquo;re all friends<br>
now<br>
Maybe<br>
you should be scared<br>
You&rsquo;re<br>
so crazy<br>
Baby<br>
who has two phones?<br>
One for her and one to<br>
still call me psycho<br>
Now that<br>
I&rsquo;m over that hill<br>
You wanna say<br>
how you feel<br>
Crazy to think<br>
that<br>
You still call me<br>
psycho<br>
You wanna talk?<br>
not ideal<br>
Heard I moved on?<br>
babe that&rsquo;s real<br>
And<br>
you&rsquo;ve got a girl<br>
But you still call me<br>
psycho</p>
