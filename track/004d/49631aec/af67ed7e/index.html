    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79405" target="_black">79405</a></p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the simple<br>
things you do<br>
I just can&rsquo;t get<br>
enough of you<br>
It&rsquo;s that perfume<br>
that you wear<br>
And the way you<br>
do your hair<br>
That I love<br>
so much<br>
And it&rsquo;s the simple<br>
things you say<br>
And how in bed<br>
we play<br>
It&rsquo;s the way you<br>
kiss my cheek<br>
When you think<br>
that I&rsquo;m asleep<br>
I love it<br>
so much<br>
I love you<br>
words I never say<br>
Friends<br>
make fun<br>
But I tell you<br>
every day<br>
Anyway lately you been<br>
getting me home safely<br>
Wake up<br>
love the coffee<br>
That you<br>
make me<br>
Ask me<br>
how my night was<br>
I like us<br>
it&rsquo;s so easy<br>
And we don&rsquo;t ever<br>
fight<br>
&lsquo;Cause you don&rsquo;t<br>
blow up my phone<br>
When your home alone<br>
assuming<br>
That I&rsquo;m doing<br>
what a guy does<br>
Trust<br>
with just the right<br>
Amount of<br>
lust<br>
Even loved<br>
by my family<br>
That a must<br>
and fun<br>
Everything<br>
we do me and you<br>
My song comes on and<br>
you dance n sing too<br>
With the windows down<br>
like G&rsquo;s<br>
We don&rsquo;t care who&rsquo;s<br>
around or who sees<br>
And everyone is<br>
jealous of my ride<br>
Because you sitting<br>
in the passenger side<br>
And it&rsquo;s the simple<br>
things you do<br>
I just can&rsquo;t get<br>
enough of you<br>
It&rsquo;s that perfume<br>
that you wear<br>
And the way<br>
you do your hair<br>
That I love<br>
so much<br>
And it&rsquo;s the simple<br>
things you say<br>
And how in bed<br>
we play<br>
It&rsquo;s the way you<br>
kiss my cheek<br>
When you think<br>
that I&rsquo;m asleep<br>
I love it<br>
so much<br>
Every day scrubbing it<br>
loving it<br>
Cruising freeways<br>
in our PJ&rsquo;s<br>
&lsquo;Cause that&rsquo;s the<br>
fun of it unless<br>
You wear that pretty<br>
black dress oh yes<br>
Catch me<br>
in a suit<br>
So I can look<br>
as good as you<br>
But I don&rsquo;t<br>
oh well<br>
With a that smile<br>
that you wear so well<br>
And the way that you<br>
cry in movies<br>
Pass you the ball and<br>
you pass it back to me<br>
Beer&rsquo;s with the guys<br>
ain&rsquo;t no thing<br>
It&rsquo;s your eyes and<br>
the simple things<br>
That make this work<br>
like it should<br>
When you rock my shirt<br>
oh you look so good<br>
So take my hand<br>
stay as long as<br>
You can<br>
with the man<br>
That tells<br>
all the jokes<br>
Only you<br>
understand<br>
And I promise<br>
to be honest<br>
If you promise to<br>
accomplish love<br>
And it&rsquo;s the simple<br>
things you do<br>
I just can&rsquo;t get<br>
enough of you<br>
It&rsquo;s that perfume<br>
that you wear<br>
And the way you<br>
do your hair<br>
That I love<br>
so much<br>
And it&rsquo;s the simple<br>
things you say<br>
And how in bed<br>
we play<br>
It&rsquo;s the way you<br>
kiss my cheek<br>
When you think<br>
that I&rsquo;m asleep<br>
I love it<br>
so much</p>
