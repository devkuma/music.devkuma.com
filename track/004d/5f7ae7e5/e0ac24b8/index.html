    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=84882" target="_black">84882</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s<br>
a girl<br>
Who sits under<br>
the bleachers<br>
Just another day<br>
eating alone<br>
And though she<br>
smiles<br>
There is something<br>
just hiding<br>
And she can&rsquo;t<br>
find a way to relate<br>
She just goes<br>
unnoticed<br>
As the crowd<br>
passes by<br>
And she&rsquo;ll pretend to<br>
be busy<br>
When inside<br>
she just wants to cry<br>
And she&rsquo;ll<br>
say<br>
Take a little<br>
look at the life of<br>
Miss always invisible<br>
look a little harder<br>
I really really<br>
want you to<br>
Put yourself<br>
in her shoes<br>
Take another<br>
look at the face of<br>
Miss always<br>
invisible<br>
Look a little<br>
closer and<br>
Maybe then<br>
you will see<br>
Why she waits for<br>
the day<br>
When you&rsquo;ll ask her<br>
her name<br>
The beginning in the<br>
first weeks of class<br>
She did everything to<br>
try and fit in<br>
But the others<br>
they couldn&rsquo;t seem to<br>
Get past all<br>
the things that<br>
Mismatched<br>
on the surface<br>
And she would<br>
close her eyes<br>
When they left and she<br>
fell down the stairs<br>
And the more that<br>
they joked<br>
And the more that<br>
they screamed<br>
She retreated to<br>
where she is now<br>
And she&rsquo;ll<br>
sing<br>
Take a little<br>
look at the life of<br>
Miss always invisible<br>
look a little harder<br>
I really really<br>
want you to<br>
Put yourself<br>
in her shoes yeah<br>
Take another<br>
look at the face of<br>
Miss always<br>
invisible<br>
Look a little<br>
closer and<br>
Maybe then<br>
you will see<br>
Why she waits for<br>
the day<br>
When you&rsquo;ll ask her<br>
her name</p>
<p>Then one day just the<br>
same as the last just<br>
The day&rsquo;s been<br>
in counting the time<br>
Came a boy who sat<br>
under the bleachers<br>
Just a little bit<br>
further behind</p>
