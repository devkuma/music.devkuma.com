<p>And I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
I&rsquo;d run right into<br>
hell and back<br>
I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
I&rsquo;ll never lie to you<br>
and that&rsquo;s a fact<br>
But I&rsquo;ll never<br>
forget the way you<br>
Feel right now<br>
oh no no way<br>
And I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
Oh I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
But I won&rsquo;t do that no<br>
I won&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>And somedays it<br>
don&rsquo;t come easy<br>
And somedays it<br>
don&rsquo;t come hard<br>
Somedays it<br>
don&rsquo;t come at all<br>
And these are the days<br>
that never end<br>
And some nights<br>
you&rsquo;re breathing fire<br>
And some nights<br>
you&rsquo;re carved in ice<br>
Some nights<br>
you&rsquo;re like nothing<br>
I&rsquo;ve ever seen before<br>
or will again<br>
And maybe I&rsquo;m crazy<br>
oh it&rsquo;s crazy<br>
And it&rsquo;s true<br>
I know you<br>
Can save me<br>
no one else<br>
Can save me<br>
now but you<br>
As long as the planets<br>
are turning<br>
As long as the stars<br>
are burning<br>
As long as your dreams<br>
are coming true<br>
You better<br>
believe it<br>
That I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
Oh I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
Oh I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
But I won&rsquo;t do that<br>
no I won&rsquo;t do that<br>
I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
Anything you&rsquo;ve been<br>
dreaming of<br>
But I just<br>
won&rsquo;t do that<br>
I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
Anything you&rsquo;ve been<br>
dreaming of<br>
But I just<br>
won&rsquo;t do<br>
And somedays<br>
I pray for silence<br>
And somedays<br>
I pray for soul<br>
Somedays I just pray<br>
to the God of sex<br>
And drums and<br>
rock &lsquo;N roll<br>
And maybe<br>
I&rsquo;m lonely<br>
That&rsquo;s all<br>
I&rsquo;m qualified to be<br>
There&rsquo;s just one<br>
and only one<br>
And only promise<br>
I can keep<br>
As long as the wheels<br>
are turning<br>
As long as the fires<br>
burning<br>
As long as<br>
your prayers<br>
Are coming true<br>
you better believe it<br>
That I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
And you know it&rsquo;s true<br>
and that&rsquo;s a fact<br>
I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
And there&rsquo;ll never be<br>
no turning back<br>
But I&rsquo;ll never do it<br>
better then I do it<br>
With you<br>
so long so long<br>
And I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
Oh I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
I would do<br>
anything for love<br>
But I won&rsquo;t do that<br>
no I won&rsquo;t do that<br>
Will you raise me up<br>
will you help me down?<br>
Will you get me<br>
right out of<br>
This Godforsaken<br>
town?<br>
Will you make it all<br>
a little less cold?<br>
I can do that<br>
oh now I can do that<br>
Will you cater to<br>
every fantasy I got?<br>
Will you hose me down<br>
with holy water<br>
If I get too hot?<br>
will you take me<br>
Places<br>
I&rsquo;ve never known?<br>
Now I can do that<br>
oh now I can do that<br>
I know the territory<br>
I&rsquo;ve been around<br>
It&rsquo;ll all<br>
turn to dust<br>
And we&rsquo;ll<br>
all fall down<br>
And sooner<br>
or later<br>
You&rsquo;ll be<br>
screwing around<br>
I won&rsquo;t do that<br>
no I won&rsquo;t do that<br>
Anything for love<br>
but I won&rsquo;t do that</p>
