    <p>KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79496" target="_black">79496</a></p>
<p>I should be patient<br>
but can&rsquo;t hardly wait<br>
Something I wanted<br>
since the first day<br>
We should go on with<br>
what we&rsquo;re<br>
Thinking &lsquo;bout<br>
how could I know<br>
And she said<br>
if you like this<br>
It&rsquo;s yours<br>
it&rsquo;s yours<br>
And I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
think about it<br>
I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
talk about it<br>
And she said do<br>
what you wish<br>
It&rsquo;s yours<br>
it&rsquo;s yours<br>
Woo look here baby<br>
ay yi yi yi<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands on you<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands<br>
On you<br>
on you<br>
Woo when we&rsquo;re faded<br>
ay yi yi yi<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands on you<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands<br>
On you<br>
on you<br>
I know you say<br>
you really like it<br>
You&rsquo;ve never been here<br>
before<br>
I think we could be<br>
on to something<br>
It feels so good<br>
to hold<br>
You tell me<br>
if it&rsquo;s too much<br>
Maybe we should<br>
take it slow<br>
I think we could be<br>
on to something<br>
When you told me<br>
baby<br>
And she said<br>
if you like this<br>
It&rsquo;s yours<br>
it&rsquo;s yours<br>
And I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
think about it<br>
I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
talk about it<br>
And she said do<br>
what you wish<br>
It&rsquo;s yours<br>
it&rsquo;s yours<br>
And I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
think about it<br>
I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
talk about it<br>
Woo look here baby<br>
ay yi yi yi<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands on you<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands<br>
On you<br>
on you<br>
Woo when we&rsquo;re faded<br>
ay yi yi yi<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands on you<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands<br>
On you<br>
on you<br>
Hey<br>
she don&rsquo;t even try<br>
But I believe<br>
she knows<br>
Tell me<br>
just how far can I go<br>
She don&rsquo;t<br>
need to try<br>
She don&rsquo;t have to<br>
act the part<br>
I love<br>
your body<br>
Face in the pillow xss<br>
where the wind blows<br>
Every time we link up<br>
sex is all we think up<br>
Body<br>
like a city<br>
I got keys<br>
and the zip code<br>
We don&rsquo;t even<br>
speak much<br>
All we do is<br>
drink up<br>
Shots of the Chamisul<br>
blue dream chief up<br>
Jagiya iri wa<br>
bballi wa gaza<br>
All this love I hope<br>
it don&rsquo;t hurt ya<br>
All this love I hope<br>
it&rsquo;s all worth it<br>
Perfect<br>
in the end perfect way<br>
Jerkin tugging<br>
on my shirt like<br>
Ay I know you<br>
wanna get a taste<br>
And she said<br>
if you like this<br>
It&rsquo;s yours<br>
it&rsquo;s yours<br>
I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
think about it<br>
I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
talk about it<br>
And she said do<br>
what you wish<br>
It&rsquo;s yours<br>
it&rsquo;s yours<br>
I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
think about it<br>
I don&rsquo;t even gotta<br>
talk about it<br>
Woo look here baby<br>
ay yi yi yi<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands on you<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands<br>
On you<br>
on you<br>
Woo when we&rsquo;re faded<br>
ay yi yi yi<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands on you<br>
I just wanna<br>
put my hands<br>
On you<br>
on you</p>
