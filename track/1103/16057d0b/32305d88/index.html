<hr>
<p>Yeah nigga we&rsquo;re still fuckin&rsquo; wit&rsquo; you<br>
Still waters run deep<br>
Still Snoop Dogg and D R E<br>
&lsquo;99 nigga guess who&rsquo;s back<br>
Still still doin&rsquo; that shit huh Dre?<br>
Oh for sho&rsquo;<br>
Yeah<br>
Check me out<br>
It&rsquo;s still Dre Day nigga AK nigga<br>
Though I&rsquo;ve grown a lot can&rsquo;t keep it home a lot<br>
&lsquo;Cause when I frequent the spots<br>
that I&rsquo;m known to rock<br>
You hear the bass from the truck<br>
when I&rsquo;m on the block<br>
Ladies they pay homage<br>
but haters say Dre fell off<br>
How? Nigga my last album was<br>
The Chronic(Nigga)<br>
They wanna know if he still got it<br>
They say rap&rsquo;s changed they wanna know<br>
how I feel about it<br>
(If you ain&rsquo;t up on thangs)<br>
Dr Dre is the name I&rsquo;m ahead of my game<br>
Still puffin&rsquo; my leaves still fuck with the beats<br>
Still not lovin&rsquo; police(Huh uh)<br>
Still rock my khakis with a cuff<br>
and a crease(For sho&rsquo;)<br>
Still got love for the streets reppin&rsquo; 213(For life)<br>
Still the beats bang still doin&rsquo; my thang<br>
Since I left ain&rsquo;t too much changed still<br>
I&rsquo;m representin&rsquo; for them gangstas<br>
all across the world<br>
(Still) hittin&rsquo; them corners in them low lows girl<br>
Still takin&rsquo; my time to perfect the beat<br>
And I still got love for the streets it&rsquo;s the D R E<br>
I&rsquo;m representin&rsquo; for them gangstas<br>
all across the world<br>
(Still) hittin&rsquo; them corners in them low lows girl<br>
Still takin&rsquo; my time to perfect the beat<br>
And I still got love for the streets it&rsquo;s the D R E<br>
Since the last time you heard from me<br>
I lost some friends<br>
Well hell me and Snoop we dippin&rsquo; again<br>
Kept my ear to the streets signed Eminem<br>
He&rsquo;s triple platinum doin&rsquo; 50 a week<br>
Still I stay close to the heat<br>
And even when I was close to defeat<br>
I rose to my feet<br>
My life&rsquo;s like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat<br>
Treat rap like Cali weed I smoke &rsquo;til I&rsquo;m &lsquo;sleep<br>
Wake up in the A M compose a beat<br>
I bring the fire &rsquo;til you&rsquo;re soakin&rsquo; in your seat<br>
It&rsquo;s not a fluke it&rsquo;s been tried I&rsquo;m the truth<br>
Since Turn Out the Lights<br>
from the World Class Wreckin Cru<br>
I&rsquo;m still at it after mathematics<br>
In the home of drive bys and ak matics<br>
Swap meets sticky green and bad traffic<br>
I dip through then I give you(Still) d R E<br>
I&rsquo;m representin&rsquo; for them gangstas<br>
all across the world<br>
(Still) hittin&rsquo; them corners in them low lows girl<br>
Still takin&rsquo; my time to perfect the beat<br>
And I still got love for the streets it&rsquo;s the D R E<br>
I&rsquo;m representin&rsquo; for them gangstas<br>
all across the world<br>
(Still) hittin&rsquo; them corners in them low lows girl<br>
Still takin&rsquo; my time to perfect the beat<br>
And I still got love for the streets it&rsquo;s the D R E<br>
It ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but more hot shit<br>
Another classic CD for y&rsquo;all to vibe with<br>
Whether you&rsquo;re coolin&rsquo; on the corner<br>
wit&rsquo; your fly bitch(Biatch)<br>
Laidback in the shack play this track<br>
I&rsquo;m representin&rsquo; for the gangstas<br>
all across the world<br>
Still(Hittin&rsquo; them corners in them<br>
low lows girl)<br>
I&rsquo;ll break your neck damn near<br>
put your face in your lap<br>
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back<br>
(So if you ain&rsquo;t up on thangs)<br>
Dr Dre be the name(What?)<br>
still runnin&rsquo; the game<br>
Still got it wrapped like a mummy<br>
Still ain&rsquo;t trippin&rsquo; love to see<br>
young blacks get money<br>
Spend time out the hood take<br>
they moms out the hood<br>
Hit my boys off with jobs<br>
no more livin&rsquo; hard(Nah nah)<br>
Barbeques every day<br>
drivin&rsquo; fancy cars(Hey hey)<br>
Still gon&rsquo; get mine regardless(Still)<br>
I&rsquo;m representin&rsquo; for them gangstas<br>
all across the world<br>
(Still) hittin&rsquo; them corners in them low lows girl<br>
Still takin&rsquo; my time to perfect the beat<br>
And I still got love for the streets it&rsquo;s the D R E<br>
I&rsquo;m representin&rsquo; for them gangstas<br>
all across the world<br>
(Still) hittin&rsquo; them corners in them low lows girl<br>
Still takin&rsquo; my time to perfect the beat<br>
And I still got love for the streets it&rsquo;s the D R E<br>
I&rsquo;m representin&rsquo; for them gangstas<br>
all across the world<br>
(Still) hittin&rsquo; them corners in them low lows girl<br>
Still takin&rsquo; my time to perfect the beat<br>
And I still got love for the streets it&rsquo;s the D R E<br>
Right back up in your mothafuckin&rsquo; ass<br>
9 5 plus four pennies add that shit up<br>
D R E right back up on top of thangs<br>
Smoke some wit&rsquo; your Dogg<br>
No stress no seeds no stems no sticks<br>
Some of that real sticky icky icky<br>
Ooh wee put it in the air<br>
Well you&rsquo;s a fool D R<br>
Ha ha</p>
