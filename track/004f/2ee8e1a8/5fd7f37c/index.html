<p>I&rsquo;m sorry Ms.Jackson<br>

Never meant to make<br>
your daughter cry<br>
I apologize<br>
a trillion times<br>
I&rsquo;m sorry Ms.Jackson<br>
woo I am for real<br>
Never meant to make<br>
your daughter cry<br>
I apologize<br>
a trillion times<br>
My baby&rsquo;s drama mama<br>
don&rsquo;t like me<br>
She be doing things<br>
like having them boys<br>
Come from<br>
her neighborhood<br>
To the studio<br>
trying to fight me<br>
She needs to get<br>
a piece of<br>
The American pie<br>
and take her bite out<br>
That&rsquo;s my house<br>
I&rsquo;ll disconnect<br>
The cable and<br>
turn the lights out<br>
And let her know<br>
her grand child<br>
Is a baby<br>
and not a paycheck<br>
Private school<br>
daycare<br>
Shit medical bills<br>
I pay that<br>
I love your mam and<br>
everything but see<br>
I ain&rsquo;t the only one<br>
who lay down<br>
She wanna rib you up<br>
to start a custody war<br>
My lawyers stay down<br>
she never got a chance<br>
To hear my side<br>
of the story<br>
We was divided<br>
she had fish fries<br>
And cookouts for<br>
my child&rsquo;s birthday<br>
I ain&rsquo;t invited<br>
despite it<br>
I show her<br>
the utmost respect<br>
When I fall through<br>
all you do<br>
Is defend that lady<br>
when I call you<br>
I&rsquo;m sorry Ms.Jackson<br>
woo I am for real<br>
Never meant to make<br>
your daughter cry<br>
I apologize<br>
a trillion time<br>
I&rsquo;m sorry Ms.Jackson<br>

Never meant to make<br>
your daughter cry<br>
I apologize<br>

Me and your daughter<br>
got a special thang<br>
Going on you say<br>
it&rsquo;s puppy love<br>
We say it&rsquo;s<br>
full- grown<br>
Hope that we feel<br>
this feel this way<br>
Forever you can plan<br>
a pretty picnic<br>
But you can&rsquo;t<br>
predict the weather<br>
Ms.Jackson<br>
ten times out of nine<br>
If I&rsquo;m lying find<br>
the quickest muzzle<br>
Throw it<br>
on my mouth<br>
And I&rsquo;ll decline<br>
King meets Queen<br>
Then the puppy<br>
love thing together<br>
Dream &lsquo;bout that crib<br>
with the goodyear<br>
Swing on the oak tree<br>
I hope we feel<br>
Like this forever<br>
forever forever ever<br>
Forever ever<br>
forever<br>
Never seems that long<br>
until you&rsquo;re grown<br>
And notice that<br>
the day by day<br>
Ruler can&rsquo;t be<br>
too wrong Ms.Jackson<br>
My intentions<br>
were good<br>
I wish I could<br>
become a magician<br>
To abracadabra<br>
all the sadder<br>
Thoughts of me<br>
thoughts of she<br>
Thoughts of he<br>
asking what happened<br>
To the feeling<br>
that her and me had<br>
I pray so much about<br>
it need some knee pads<br>
It happened<br>
for a reason<br>
One can&rsquo;t be mad<br>
so know this know<br>
That everything&rsquo;s cool<br>
and yes<br>
I will be present<br>
on the first day<br>
Of school<br>
and graduation<br>
I&rsquo;m sorry Ms.Jackson<br>

Never meant to make<br>
your daughter cry<br>
I apologize<br>
a trillion times<br>
I&rsquo;m sorry Ms.Jackson<br>
woo I am for real<br>
Never meant to make<br>
your daughter cry<br>
I apologize<br>

Look at the way<br>
you treat me<br>
You see your little<br>
nosy ass home<br>
Girl done got<br>
your ass sent up<br>
The creak G<br>

You left to straddle<br>
and ride this thing<br>
On out now<br>

Ain&rsquo;t speaking<br>

Cause my dick<br>

You know what I&rsquo;m<br>

Infidelity envy<br>

And D to the G<br>

But who you placing<br>

Let bygones be bygones<br>
