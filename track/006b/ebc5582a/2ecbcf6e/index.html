<p>I think some words are<br>
overdue<br>
Could we just<br>
do it over<br>
Can we just<br>
talk it out<br>
Like friends because<br>
I need your shoulder<br>
I know we ended<br>
on the wrong terms<br>
But I said<br>
we&rsquo;re past it<br>
So why you textin&rsquo; me<br>
with questions<br>
You don&rsquo;t gotta<br>
ask me like<br>
I know it&rsquo;s random<br>
how you been<br>
Do you remember<br>
&lsquo;bout this band<br>
You said<br>
you listened to<br>
While we were younger<br>
while we were softer<br>
While we were<br>
all about each other<br>
Hope life is treatin&rsquo;<br>
you better<br>
Better<br>
better<br>
Girl what&rsquo;s with that<br>
yo cut the act<br>
&lsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t got<br>
time for laughs<br>
No I do not want<br>
the past<br>
But if you are<br>
ever in need<br>
And God has you down<br>
on your knees<br>
And you do not know<br>
who to be<br>
Then go on<br>
and come home to me<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m here<br>
if you need me<br>
I&rsquo;ll be here<br>
right here<br>
Said I&rsquo;m here<br>
if you need me<br>
I&rsquo;ll be here<br>
right here oh<br>
And now you&rsquo;re<br>
likin&rsquo; this new guy<br>
I know you always<br>
want a new life<br>
I hope he taking care<br>
of you like<br>
The way you cared<br>
for me in my time<br>
See you got yourself<br>
some new friends<br>
No you don&rsquo;t need<br>
to go to Houston<br>
You got me thinkin&rsquo;<br>
back about then<br>
Girl I wonder<br>
why you textin&rsquo;<br>
Girl what&rsquo;s with that<br>
yo cut the act<br>
&lsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t got<br>
time for laughs<br>
No I do not want<br>
the past<br>
But if you are<br>
ever in need<br>
And God has you down<br>
on your knees<br>
And you do not know<br>
who to be<br>
Then go on<br>
and come home to me<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m here<br>
if you need me<br>
I&rsquo;ll be here<br>
right here<br>
Said I&rsquo;m here<br>
if you need me<br>
I&rsquo;ll be here<br>
right here oh</p>
