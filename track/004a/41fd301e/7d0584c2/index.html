<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting<br>
all day here<br>
For you babe<br>
so won&rsquo;t you come<br>
And sit and<br>
talk to me<br>
And tell me<br>
how we&rsquo;re gonna<br>
Be together always<br>
I hope you know<br>
That when it&rsquo;s<br>
late at night<br>
I hold on<br>
to my pillow tight<br>
And think of how you<br>
promised me forever<br>
(I never thought<br>
that anyone)<br>
Could make me feel<br>
this way oh<br>
(Now that you&rsquo;re here<br>
boy all I want)<br>
Is just a chance<br>
to say<br>
Get out (leave)<br>
right now<br>
It&rsquo;s the end<br>
of you and me<br>
It&rsquo;s too late (now)<br>
and I can&rsquo;t wait<br>
For you to be gone<br>
&lsquo;cause I know<br>
About her (move)<br>
and I wonder (why)<br>
How I bought<br>
all the lies<br>
You said that<br>
you would<br>
Treat me right<br>
but you was<br>
Just a waste of time<br>
(waste of time)<br>
Tell me why<br>
you&rsquo;re looking<br>
So confused<br>
when I&rsquo;m the one<br>
Who didn&rsquo;t know<br>
the truth<br>
How could you<br>
ever be so cold<br>
To go behind my back<br>
and call my friend<br>
Boy you must&rsquo;ve gone<br>
and bumped your head<br>
Because you left her<br>
number on your phone<br>
(So now after all<br>
is said and done)<br>
May be I&rsquo;m the one<br>
to blame but<br>
(To think that you<br>
could be the one)<br>
Well it didn&rsquo;t<br>
work out that way<br>
Get out (leave)<br>
right now<br>
It&rsquo;s the end<br>
of you and me<br>
It&rsquo;s too late (now)<br>
and I can&rsquo;t wait<br>
For you to be gone<br>
&lsquo;cause I know<br>
About her (move)<br>
and I wonder (why)<br>
How I bought<br>
all the lies<br>
You said that<br>
you would<br>
Treat me right<br>
but you was<br>
Just a waste of time<br>
(waste of time)<br>
I wanted you<br>
right here with me<br>
But I have no choice<br>
you&rsquo;ve gotta leave<br>
Because my heart<br>
is breakin&rsquo;<br>
With every word<br>
I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo;<br>
Oh I gave up<br>
everything I had<br>
On something that<br>
just wouldn&rsquo;t last<br>
But I refuse to cry<br>
no tears will fall<br>
From these eyes<br>
oh oh get out<br>
Get out (leave)<br>
right now<br>
It&rsquo;s the end<br>
of you and me<br>
It&rsquo;s too late (now)<br>
and I can&rsquo;t wait<br>
For you to be gone<br>
&lsquo;cause I know<br>
About her (move)<br>
and I wonder (why)<br>
How I bought<br>
all the lies<br>
You said that<br>
you would<br>
Treat me right<br>
but you was<br>
Just a waste of time<br>
(waste of time)<br>
Get out (leave)<br>
right now<br>
It&rsquo;s the end<br>
of you and me<br>
It&rsquo;s too late (now)<br>
and I can&rsquo;t wait<br>
For you to be gone<br>
&lsquo;cause I know<br>

all the lies<br>
You said that<br>
you would<br>

but you was<br>
Just a waste of time<br>
(waste of time)<br>
Get out (leave)<br>
you and me<br>
It&rsquo;s too late (now)<br>
about her (move why)<br>
You said that<br>
you would<br>
Treat me right<br>
but you was<br>
Just a waste of time<br>
(waste of time)</p>
