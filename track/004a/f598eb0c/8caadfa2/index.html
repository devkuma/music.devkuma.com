<p>She said he said she said<br>
She said he said she said</p>
<p>I saw you in the back of the room<br>
Takin&rsquo; shots with your friends again<br>
You talk shit like you always do<br>
I guess high school never ends</p>
<p>You sure got a lot to say<br>
When you&rsquo;re talking on my name<br>
You sure got a lot to say<br>
But did you tell them everything?</p>
<p>Oh and when you dance with the devil<br>
The devil&rsquo;s gonna dance with you<br>
Oh and when you play with fire<br>
The flame&rsquo;s gonna burn you too</p>
<p>Starting rumors<br>
It&rsquo;s nothing new yeah<br>
We&rsquo;re on this shit again<br>
She said he said she said<br>
Just can&rsquo;t get over<br>
I let you go yeah<br>
Let&rsquo;s put this shit to bed<br>
She said he said she said</p>
<p>She said he said she said<br>
She said he said she said<br>
She said he said she said<br>
She said he said she said</p>
<p>Night ends and you call me again<br>
Said you didn&rsquo;t mean what you said<br>
But drunk talks and sober thoughts<br>
So don&rsquo;t act so innocent</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t keep playing games<br>
When your rules are always changing so<br>
If you&rsquo;re saying sorry<br>
You can save it</p>
<p>Oh and when you dance with the devil<br>
The devil&rsquo;s gonna dance with you<br>
Oh and when you play with fire<br>
The flames gonna burn you too</p>
<p>Starting rumors<br>
It&rsquo;s nothing new yeah<br>
We&rsquo;re on this shit again<br>
She said he said she said<br>
Just can&rsquo;t get over<br>
I let you go yeah<br>
Let&rsquo;s put this shit to bed<br>
She said he said she said</p>
<p>She said he said she said<br>
She said he said she said<br>
She said he said she said<br>
She said he said she said</p>
<p>Burn your bridge<br>
Talk your shit<br>
I&rsquo;ve been growin&rsquo; thicker skin<br>
Forgiveness<br>
Ask again<br>
Patience only runs so thin</p>
<p>Starting rumors<br>
It&rsquo;s nothing new yeah<br>
We&rsquo;re on this shit again<br>
She said he said she said<br>
Just can&rsquo;t get over<br>
I let you go yeah<br>
Let&rsquo;s put this shit to bed<br>
She said he said she said</p>
