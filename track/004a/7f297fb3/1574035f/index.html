    <p>작곡: Jason Mraz / 작사: Words &amp; Music by<br>
KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=60979" target="_black">60979</a> / KY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TJKaraoke/search?query=21941" target="_black">21941</a></p>
<p>Oh was it you<br>
who spoke the words<br>
That things would<br>
happen but not to me<br>
All things are gonna<br>
happen naturally<br>
Oh taking<br>
your advice<br>
And I&rsquo;m looking<br>
on the bright side<br>
And balancing<br>
the whole thing<br>
Oh but at often times<br>
those words get<br>
Tangled up<br>
in a lines<br>
And the bright lights<br>
turn to night<br>
Oh until the dawn<br>
it brings<br>
Another day<br>
to sing<br>
About the magic<br>
that was you and me<br>
Cause you and I<br>
both loved<br>
What you and I<br>
spoke of<br>
And others just<br>
read of<br>
Others only read of<br>
of the love<br>
Of the love<br>
that I loved<br>
Yeah<br>
lova lova<br>
See I&rsquo;m all about them<br>
words<br>
Over numbers<br>
unencumbered<br>
Numbered words<br>
hundreds of pages<br>
Pages pages for words<br>
more words<br>
Then I had ever heard<br>
and I feel so alive<br>
Cause you and I<br>
both loved<br>
What you and I<br>
spoke of of<br>
And others just<br>
read of<br>
And if you could<br>
see me now<br>
Oh love love<br>
you and I<br>
You and I<br>
not so little<br>
You and I<br>
anymore<br>
Uhm uhm<br>
uhm uhm<br>
And with this silence<br>
brings a moral story<br>
More importantly<br>
evolving is<br>
The glory<br>
of a boy<br>
Cause you and I<br>
both loved<br>
What you and I<br>
spoke of of<br>
And others just<br>
read of<br>
And if you could<br>
see me now<br>
Well them I&rsquo;m almost<br>
finally out of<br>
I&rsquo;m finally out of<br>
finally<br>
Din di ri<br>
di di di ri<br>
Well I&rsquo;m almost<br>
finally finally<br>
Well I am free<br>
oh I&rsquo;m free<br>
And it&rsquo;s okay<br>
if you had to go away<br>
Oh just remember<br>
the telephones<br>
Well the work out of<br>
both ways<br>
But if I never ever<br>
hear them ring<br>
If nothing else<br>
I&rsquo;ll think<br>
The bells<br>
inside<br>
Have finally<br>
found you<br>
Someone else<br>
and that&rsquo;s okay<br>
Cause I&rsquo;ll remember<br>
everything you sang<br>
Cause you and I<br>
both loved<br>
What you and I<br>
spoke of of<br>
And others just<br>
read of<br>
And if you could<br>
see me now<br>
Well then I&rsquo;m almost<br>
finally out of<br>
I&rsquo;m finally out of<br>
finally<br>
Di di ri<br>
ri di di ri<br>
Well I&rsquo;m almost<br>
finally finally<br>
Out of<br>
words</p>
