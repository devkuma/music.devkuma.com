<p>I still see your<br>
shadows in my room<br>
Can&rsquo;t take back<br>
the love<br>
That I gave you<br>
it&rsquo;s to the point<br>
Where I love<br>
and I hate you<br>
And I cannot<br>
change you<br>
So I must<br>
replace you oh<br>
Easier said<br>
than done<br>
I thought<br>
you were the one<br>
Listenin&rsquo; to my heart<br>
instead of my head<br>
You found<br>
another one<br>
But I am<br>
the better one<br>
I won&rsquo;t let you<br>
forget me<br>

instead of my head<br>
You found<br>
another one<br>
But I am<br>
the better one<br>
I won&rsquo;t let you<br>
forget me<br>
You left me<br>
falling<br>
And landing<br>
inside my grave<br>
I know<br>
that you want me dead<br>
I take prescriptions<br>
to make me feel A-okay<br>
I know<br>
it&rsquo;s all in my head<br>
I have<br>
these lucid dreams<br>
Where I can&rsquo;t move<br>
a thing<br>
Thinking of you<br>
in my bed<br>
You were<br>
my everything<br>
Thoughts<br>
of a wedding ring<br>
Now I&rsquo;m just better<br>
off dead<br>
I&rsquo;ll do it over<br>
again<br>
I didn&rsquo;t want it<br>
to end<br>
I watch it blow<br>
in the wind<br>
I should&rsquo;ve listened<br>
to my friends<br>
Leave this xhit<br>
in the past<br>
But I want it<br>
to last<br>
You were made outta<br>
plastic fake<br>
I was tangled up<br>
in your drastic ways<br>
Who knew evil girls<br>
had the prettiest face<br>
You gave me<br>
a heart<br>
That was<br>
full of mistakes<br>
I gave you<br>
my heart<br>
And you made<br>
heart break<br>
You made<br>
my heart break<br>
You made<br>
my heartache<br>
You made<br>
my heart break<br>
You made<br>
my heartache<br>
You made<br>
my heart break<br>
You made<br>
my heartache<br>
You made<br>
my heart break again<br>
I still see your<br>
shadows in my room<br>
Can&rsquo;t take back<br>
the love<br>
That I gave you<br>
it&rsquo;s to the point<br>
Where I love<br>
and I hate you<br>
And I cannot<br>
