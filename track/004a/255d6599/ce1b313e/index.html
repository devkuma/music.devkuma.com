<p>Yo<br>
I&rsquo;ve seen this<br>
One young lady walking<br>
down the street<br>
Everything was<br>
done from her<br>
Hair to her feet<br>
with some<br>
Coach kicks<br>
tight Guess jeans<br>
LV bag<br>
shirt was from Armani<br>
So I ran up and said<br>
&ldquo;W&rsquo;sup?&rdquo;<br>
Introduced myself<br>
properly<br>
But she didn&rsquo;t give a<br>
what?<br>
So confused<br>
what did I do wrong<br>
Now where have all the<br>
cool girls gone<br>
Don&rsquo;t care about<br>
your<br>
Gucci Louis<br>
Fendi Prada<br>
Them things like that<br>
don&rsquo;t make me want ya<br>
I&rsquo;m just looking for<br>
other things<br>
Like a dope<br>
conversation<br>
With<br>
another being<br>
Gucci Louis<br>
Fendi Prada<br>
Them things like that<br>
don&rsquo;t make me want ya<br>
I&rsquo;m just looking for<br>
other things<br>
Like a dope<br>
conversation<br>
With<br>
another being<br>
Beautiful girls<br>
in a confused world<br>
In your flashy<br>
necklace<br>
And your<br>
long curls<br>
Now let me take this<br>
opportunity to<br>
Tell you that your<br>
Louis Vougue<br>
And True Religion<br>
jeans are skeptical<br>
You can have less<br>
no need to impress<br>
More money<br>
more problems<br>
Leading<br>
to stress<br>
Compulsively<br>
sliding cards<br>
Sticking in debt<br>
unimportant things<br>
Quickly<br>
become the asset<br>
See<br>
I&rsquo;m the kinda dude<br>
Who likes a<br>
simple chick<br>
Who&rsquo;d rather<br>
skip a party<br>
For a night<br>
just to catch a flick<br>
&lsquo;Cause nothing else<br>
matters to me you see<br>
I&rsquo;m just a little bit<br>
antsy fancy<br>
With a<br>
tad bit of<br>
Taste and some<br>
easy beauty<br>
And a laid back cool<br>
chill personality<br>
So pretty please<br>
don&rsquo;t get offended<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m a<br>
normal guy<br>
But I just like women<br>
that don&rsquo;t have to try<br>
Don&rsquo;t care about<br>
your<br>
Gucci Louis<br>
Fendi Prada<br>
Them things like that<br>
don&rsquo;t make me want ya<br>
I&rsquo;m just looking for<br>
other things<br>

Fendi Prada<br>

don&rsquo;t make me want ya<br>
I&rsquo;m just looking for<br>
other things<br>
Like a dope<br>
conversation<br>
With<br>
another being</p>
<p>Gucci Louis<br>
Fendi Prada<br>
Them things like that<br>
don&rsquo;t make me want ya<br>
I&rsquo;m just looking for<br>

don&rsquo;t make me want ya<br>
I&rsquo;m just looking for<br>
other things<br>
Like a dope<br>
conversation<br>
With<br>
another being<br>
Cool girls<br>
all around the world<br>
Now throw your<br>
hands up in the air<br>
If you got the<br>
simple things<br>
Keep &rsquo;em up like you<br>
really don&rsquo;t care<br>
