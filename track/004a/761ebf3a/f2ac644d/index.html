<p>It&rsquo;s such a shame<br>
but I&rsquo;m leaving<br>
Can&rsquo;t take the way<br>
you&rsquo;re mistreating me<br>
And it&rsquo;s crazy<br>
but oh baby<br>
It don&rsquo;t matter<br>
whatever<br>
Don&rsquo;t phase me<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe<br>
You want to<br>
leave like this<br>
I don&rsquo;t believe<br>
I just had my last<br>
Real kiss<br>
I do believe<br>
We&rsquo;ll laugh<br>
and reminisce<br>
Wait a minute<br>
don&rsquo;t bounce baby<br>
Let&rsquo;s talk about<br>
this man<br>
Well I&rsquo;m bouncing<br>
and I&rsquo;m out son<br>
I gotta leave you<br>
alone<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m good<br>
holding down my spot<br>
And I&rsquo;m good repping<br>
the girls<br>
On the block and<br>
I&rsquo;m good<br>
I got this thing<br>
on lock<br>
So without me<br>
you&rsquo;ll be fine right<br>
All my pride is<br>
all I have<br>
(Pride is what you had<br>
baby girl<br>
I&rsquo;m what you have)<br>
you&rsquo;ll be needing me<br>
But too bad<br>
(be easy<br>
Don&rsquo;t make decisions<br>
when you mad)<br>
You packed your choice<br>
to run alone<br>
(I know you&rsquo;re<br>
independent<br>
But you can&rsquo;t make it<br>
on your own)<br>
Here with me<br>
you had a home<br>
(But time is of<br>
the essence<br>
Why spend it<br>
alone huh)<br>
The nights<br>
I waited up<br>
For you promises<br>
you made about<br>
Coming through<br>
so much time<br>
You wasted that&rsquo;s why<br>
I had to replace you<br>
It makes a cat nervous<br>
the thought of<br>
Settling down<br>
especially me<br>
I was creeping<br>
all over town<br>
I thought my tender<br>
touch could<br>
Lock you down<br>
I knew<br>
I had you as cocky<br>
as it sounds<br>
That&rsquo;s the way you<br>
used to giggle right<br>
Before I put it down<br>
it&rsquo;s better<br>
When you angry<br>
come here<br>
I&rsquo;ll prove it now<br>
come here<br>
Stop playing<br>
you gaming<br>
I gotta leave you<br>
alone<br>
&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m good<br>
holding down my spot<br>
And I&rsquo;m good<br>
repping the girls<br>
On the block<br>
and I&rsquo;m good<br>
I got this thing<br>
on lock<br>
So without me<br>
you&rsquo;ll be fine right<br>
All my pride is<br>
all I have<br>
(Pride is what<br>
you had baby girl<br>
I&rsquo;m what you have)<br>
you&rsquo;ll be needing me<br>
But too bad<br>
(be easy<br>
Don&rsquo;t make decisions<br>
when you mad)<br>
You packed your choice<br>
to run alone<br>
(I know you&rsquo;re<br>
independent<br>
But you can&rsquo;t make it<br>
on you own)<br>
Here with me<br>
you had a home<br>
(But time is of<br>
the essence<br>
Why spend it<br>
alone huh)<br>
People make mistakes<br>
to make up<br>
To break to wake up<br>
cold and lonely chill<br>
Baby you know me<br>
you love me<br>
I&rsquo;m like your homey<br>
instead of beef<br>
You come hold me<br>
I promise<br>
I&rsquo;m not a phony<br>
don&rsquo;t bounce<br>
Baby cousole me<br>
come here<br>
Ain&rsquo;t nothing<br>
you can say to me<br>
That can change<br>
my mind<br>
I gotta let you go<br>
now and nothing<br>
Will ever be the same<br>
so just be<br>
On your way go ahead<br>
and do your thing now<br>
And there&rsquo;s no<br>
more to explain<br>
To me you no I know<br>
your game and<br>
I&rsquo;m feeling<br>
what you do<br>
So I&rsquo;m bouncing<br>
and I&rsquo;m out son<br>
I gotta leave you<br>
alone yeah- yeah-<br>
All my pride is<br>
all I have<br>
(Pride is what<br>
you had baby girl<br>
I&rsquo;m what you have)<br>
you&rsquo;ll be needing me<br>
But too bad<br>
(be easy<br>
Don&rsquo;t make decisions<br>
when you mad)<br>
You packed your choice<br>
to run alone<br>
(I know<br>
you&rsquo;re independent<br>
But you can&rsquo;t make it<br>
on you own)<br>
Here with me<br>
you had a home<br>
(But time is of<br>
the essence<br>
Why spend it<br>
alone huh)<br>
