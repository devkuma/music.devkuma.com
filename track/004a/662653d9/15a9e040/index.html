<p>Said all<br>
I want from you<br>
Is to see you tomorrow<br>
and every tomorrow<br>
Maybe you&rsquo;ll let me<br>
borrow your heart<br>
And is it too much to<br>
ask for every Sunday<br>
And while<br>
we&rsquo;re at it throw<br>
In every other day<br>
to start<br>
I know people make<br>
promises all the time<br>
Then they turn right<br>
around and break them<br>
When someone<br>
cuts your heart<br>
Open with a knife<br>
and you&rsquo;re bleeding<br>
But<br>
I could be that guy<br>
To heal it<br>
over time<br>
And I won&rsquo;t stop<br>
until you believe it<br>
&lsquo;Cause baby<br>
you&rsquo;re worth it<br>
So don&rsquo;t act like<br>
it&rsquo;s a bad thing to<br>
Fall in love<br>
with me<br>
&lsquo;Cause you might<br>
look around<br>
And find your dreams<br>
come true with me<br>
Spend all your time<br>
and your money<br>
Just to find out<br>
that my love was free<br>
So don&rsquo;t act like<br>
it&rsquo;s a bad thing to<br>
Fall in love<br>
with me me<br>
It&rsquo;s not<br>
a bad thing to<br>
Fall in love<br>
with me me<br>
Now how about<br>
I&rsquo;d be the last voice<br>
You hear tonight<br>
and every other night<br>
For the rest of the<br>
nights that there are<br>
Every morning<br>
I just wanna see you<br>
Staring<br>
back at me<br>
&lsquo;Cause I know that&rsquo;s<br>
a good place to start<br>
I know people make<br>
promises all the time<br>
Then they turn right<br>
around and break them<br>
When someone<br>
cuts your heart<br>
Open with a knife<br>
and you&rsquo;re bleeding<br>
Don&rsquo;t you<br>
know<br>
But<br>
I could be that guy<br>
To heal it<br>
over time<br>
And I won&rsquo;t stop<br>
until you believe it<br>
&lsquo;Cause baby<br>
you&rsquo;re worth it<br>
So don&rsquo;t act like<br>
it&rsquo;s a bad thing to<br>
Fall in love<br>
with me<br>
&lsquo;Cause you might<br>
look around<br>
And find your dreams<br>
come true with me<br>
Spend all your time<br>
and your money<br>
Just to find out<br>
that my love was free<br>
So don&rsquo;t act like<br>
it&rsquo;s a bad thing to<br>
Fall in love<br>
with me me<br>
It&rsquo;s not<br>
a bad thing<br>
To fall in love<br>
with me me<br>
Not such a bad thing<br>
to fall in love<br>
No I won&rsquo;t<br>
fill your mind<br>
With broken promises<br>
and wasted time<br>
And if you fall<br>
you&rsquo;ll always land<br>
Right in these arms<br>
these arms of mine<br>
Don&rsquo;t act like<br>
it&rsquo;s a bad thing to<br>
Fall in love<br>
with me<br>
&lsquo;Cause you might<br>
look around<br>
And find your dreams<br>
come true with me<br>
Spend all your time<br>
and your money<br>
Just to find out<br>
that my love was free<br>
So don&rsquo;t act like<br>
it&rsquo;s a bad thing to<br>
Fall in love<br>
with me me<br>
It&rsquo;s not<br>
a bad thing to<br>
Fall in love<br>
with me me<br>
Not such<br>
a bad thing to<br>
Fall in love<br>
with me</p>
