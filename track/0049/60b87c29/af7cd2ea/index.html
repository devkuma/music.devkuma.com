<p>You&rsquo;ve never had<br>
a real birthday before<br>
Except<br>
of course<br>
The ones just spent<br>
outside my locked door<br>
So I&rsquo;m here way<br>
too late<br>
To help you<br>
celebrate<br>
And be your birthday<br>
date<br>
If I may<br>
achoo<br>
Elsa I&rsquo;m thinking<br>
you might have a cold<br>
I don&rsquo;t get colds<br>
besides<br>
A cold never<br>
bothered me anyway<br>
Just<br>
follow the string<br>
I&rsquo;ve got<br>
big plans<br>
I&rsquo;ve got surprises<br>
for today<br>
Nothing but nothing&rsquo;s<br>
gonna get in our way<br>
I&rsquo;ve worked<br>
for weeks<br>
Planned everything<br>
within my power<br>
I even got<br>
Kristoff and Sven<br>
To take<br>
a shower<br>
If someone wants<br>
to hold me back<br>
I&rsquo;d like<br>
to see them try<br>
I&rsquo;m on the birthday<br>

I&rsquo;m giving you the sun<br>
the moon and the sky<br>
I&rsquo;m making today<br>
a perfect day for you<br>
I&rsquo;m making today<br>
a blast<br>
If it&rsquo;s the last thing<br>

For everything<br>

But I&rsquo;m still<br>
concerned for you<br>
I think<br>
it&rsquo;s time<br>
That you go home<br>
and get some rest<br>
We are not<br>
stopping<br>
&lsquo;Cause the next one is<br>
the best ah achoo<br>
Elsa<br>

No way we have<br>
to paint the town<br>
But you need<br>
medical attention<br>
Are you<br>
sick<br>
How &lsquo;bout a cold<br>
remedy<br>
Of my own<br>
invention<br>
No thanks<br>
we&rsquo;ll take it<br>
We&rsquo;re making today<br>
a perfect day for you<br>
Making today<br>
a special day<br>
We&rsquo;re singing<br>
a birthday song<br>
To make your wishes<br>
come true<br>
We love Princess Anna<br>
and I love you too<br>
So we&rsquo;re making<br>
today a perfect day<br>
Yes we are making<br>
today a perfect day<br>
Come on<br>

Elsa that&rsquo;s too much<br>
you need to rest<br>
No we need to get<br>
to our birthday chills<br>
I mean<br>
thrills<br>
Making dreams<br>
making plans<br>
Go go<br>
go go<br>
Follow the string<br>
to the end<br>
You are<br>
my very best friend<br>
Elsa(what)<br>
I&rsquo;m fine<br>
We&rsquo;re gonna climb<br>

Follow the string<br>

Hot cold hot<br>

Let&rsquo;s put this day<br>
on hold<br>
