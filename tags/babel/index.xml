        &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Her penultimate sighs called softy on the kindling winds&lt;br&gt;
Her saintly eyes filling with tears living with truth&lt;br&gt;
and then a golden flash like the onset of heaven&lt;br&gt;
leaving her screams breaking my heart&lt;br&gt;
and in the grip of fire&lt;br&gt;
i knew the Death of love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where will you be they tense for warfare?&lt;br&gt;
What will you see with your innocence there?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be my darling?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be they tense for warfare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where will you be when God is glorifying?&lt;br&gt;
There we will be between the dead and dying&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be my darling?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be when God is glorifying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain&lt;br&gt;
For lying passive in the shadows whilst the enemy reigns&lt;br&gt;
Devoted to the votive, holy standard above&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;By command of the king of Heaven&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
Came the death of love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where will you be when they&amp;rsquo;re vilifying?&lt;br&gt;
How will they see when the truth is blinding?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be my darling?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be when they&amp;rsquo;re vilifying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where will you be when the dark is rising?&lt;br&gt;
How will you keep from it&amp;rsquo;s terrorizing?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be my darling?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be when the dark is rising?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom&lt;br&gt;
On the saintly iron maiden as she fell from her wound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But visions and ambition&lt;br&gt;
Never listened to submission&lt;br&gt;
And she was on a mission from the highest above&lt;br&gt;
To Lord upon the slaughter&lt;br&gt;
Like a sword through hissing water&lt;br&gt;
She arose where archers sought her&lt;br&gt;
For the death of love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The righteous death of love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilles adored her drama&lt;br&gt;
Her suit of pure white armour&lt;br&gt;
Blazed against the English in a torrent of light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as they rallied onto night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cancer fled his soul&lt;br&gt;
Dissolving&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framed amid the thick of fire&lt;br&gt;
Aflame, a Valkyrie&lt;br&gt;
She made him click without desire&lt;br&gt;
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even when they caught her breath&lt;br&gt;
Her words would leave a scar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;For only in the grip of darkness&lt;br&gt;
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will you breathe when their wheels are turning?&lt;br&gt;
How will you know if the sky is burning?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be my darling?&lt;br&gt;
How will you breathe when their wheels are turning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where will you be when Babel builds my fire?&lt;br&gt;
Will you not flee and label me pariah?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be my darling?&lt;br&gt;
Where will you be when they light my pyre?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aligned with Joan in all&lt;br&gt;
That was enthroned and divine&lt;br&gt;
He swore to score the crimes&lt;br&gt;
Jackdaws poured on this dove&lt;br&gt;
Crimes he knew alone&lt;br&gt;
Derived from minds of the blind&lt;br&gt;
The church unfurled for murder perched&lt;br&gt;
Upon the death of love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framed amid the thick of fire&lt;br&gt;
Aflame, a Valkyrie&lt;br&gt;
She claimed the skies were lit with spires&lt;br&gt;
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even when she fought for breath&lt;br&gt;
Her words would leave a scar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;For only in the grip of darkness&lt;br&gt;
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Death Of Love(Demo)&lt;br&gt;
Cradle Of Filth&lt;/p&gt;
