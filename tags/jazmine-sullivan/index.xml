        &lt;p&gt;I bust the windows&lt;br&gt;
out your car&lt;br&gt;
And no it didn&amp;rsquo;t mend&lt;br&gt;
my broken heart&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll probably always&lt;br&gt;
have these ugly scars&lt;br&gt;
But right now I don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
care about that part&lt;br&gt;
I bust the windows&lt;br&gt;
out your car&lt;br&gt;
After I saw you laying&lt;br&gt;
next to her&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna&lt;br&gt;
but I took my turn&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did it&lt;br&gt;
cuz you had to learn&lt;br&gt;
I must admit it&lt;br&gt;
helped a little bit&lt;br&gt;
To think of how you&amp;rsquo;d&lt;br&gt;
feel when you saw it&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that I&lt;br&gt;
had that much strength&lt;br&gt;
But I&amp;rsquo;m glad you see&lt;br&gt;
what happens when&lt;br&gt;
You see&lt;br&gt;
you can&amp;rsquo;t just play&lt;br&gt;
With people&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
feelings&lt;br&gt;
Tell them you love&lt;br&gt;
them and don&amp;rsquo;t mean it&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll probably say&lt;br&gt;
that it was juvenile&lt;br&gt;
But I think that&lt;br&gt;
I deserve to smile&lt;br&gt;
I bust the windows&lt;br&gt;
out your car&lt;br&gt;
You know I did it&lt;br&gt;
cuz I left my mark&lt;br&gt;
Wrote my initials&lt;br&gt;
with a crowbar&lt;br&gt;
And then I drove off&lt;br&gt;
into the dark&lt;br&gt;
I bust the windows&lt;br&gt;
out your car&lt;br&gt;
You should feel lucky&lt;br&gt;
that was all I did&lt;br&gt;
After five whole&lt;br&gt;
years of this bullshit&lt;br&gt;
Gave you all of me and&lt;br&gt;
you played with it&lt;br&gt;
I must admit it&lt;br&gt;
helped a little bit&lt;br&gt;
To think of how you&amp;rsquo;d&lt;br&gt;
feel when you saw it&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that I&lt;br&gt;
had that much strength&lt;br&gt;
But I&amp;rsquo;m glad you see&lt;br&gt;
what happens when&lt;br&gt;
You see&lt;br&gt;
you can&amp;rsquo;t just play&lt;br&gt;
With people&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
feelings&lt;br&gt;
Tell them you love&lt;br&gt;
them and don&amp;rsquo;t mean it&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll probably say&lt;br&gt;
that it was juvenile&lt;br&gt;
But I think that&lt;br&gt;
I deserve to smile&lt;br&gt;
I bust the windows&lt;br&gt;
out your car&lt;br&gt;
But it don&amp;rsquo;t come back&lt;br&gt;
to my broken heart&lt;br&gt;
You could never feel&lt;br&gt;
how I felt that day&lt;br&gt;
Until that&lt;br&gt;
happens baby&lt;br&gt;
You don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;br&gt;
pain oh&lt;br&gt;
Yeah I did it&lt;br&gt;
you should know it&lt;br&gt;
I ain&amp;rsquo;t sorry&lt;br&gt;
you deserved it&lt;br&gt;
After what you&lt;br&gt;
did to me&lt;br&gt;
You deserved it&lt;br&gt;
I ain&amp;rsquo;t sorry no no&lt;br&gt;
You broke my heart&lt;br&gt;
so I broke your car&lt;br&gt;
You caused me pain&lt;br&gt;
so I did the same&lt;br&gt;
Even though&lt;br&gt;
what you did to me&lt;br&gt;
Was much&lt;br&gt;
worse&lt;br&gt;
I had to do something&lt;br&gt;
to make you hurt yeah&lt;br&gt;
Oh but why am&lt;br&gt;
I still crying?&lt;br&gt;
Why am I the one&lt;br&gt;
whose still crying?&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh you really&lt;br&gt;
hurt me baby&lt;br&gt;
You really you really&lt;br&gt;
hurt me baby&lt;br&gt;
I bust the windows&lt;br&gt;
out your car&lt;/p&gt;
