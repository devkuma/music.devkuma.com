                Feels like a disrespectful oversimplification To say we wanted different things To brush it off with an explanation Like attachments styles and timing You were my everything Maybe thats part of the problem But I wouldnt change a thing Not from the moment it started When you think of me Are you settin fire to every memory And do you believe What doesnt last forever dont mean anything Cause I swear I loved you fully And Im sorry not for stayin who we thought Id be When you think of me Am I just another man who leaves Just another man who leaves I hate myself for hurting you but it would make it worse to fix it I wish Id figured out a way of keepin myself in it Cause I meant to be the man you were standin with Not another tally line to justify your fear of abandonment And I hate how I lived up to your worst fears Makes it worse how it worked so well for three years And it could all be for the best in the end But for now it feels like losin my best friend When you think of me Are you settin fire to every memory And do you believe What doesnt last forever dont mean anything Cause I swear I loved you fully And Im sorry not for stayin who we thought Id be When you think of me Am I just another man who leaves Just another man who leaves You were my everything Maybe thats part of the problem But I wouldnt change a thing Not from the moment it started When you think of me Are you settin fire to every memory And do you believe What doesnt last forever dont mean anything Cause I swear I loved you fully And Im sorry not for stayin who we thought Id be When you think of me Am I just another man who leaves
