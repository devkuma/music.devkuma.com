                Heaven knows what youve been through So much pain even though You cant see me Im not far away We always say if one of us Somehow went away Wed light a candle and say a prayer Know that love still remains Close your eyes go to sleep Know my love is all around Dream in peace when you wake You will know Im still with you Live your life from this day on And love again I know youd do the same for me Thats the way that love is supposed to be Close your eyes go to sleep Know my love is all around Dream in peace when you wake You will know Im still with you When you feel those lonely teardrops Rolling down your face Just know my love watches over you Always always Close your eyes and go to sleep Know my love is all around Dream in peace when you wake You will know Im still with you Close your eyes go to sleep Know my love is all around Dream in peace when you wake You will know Im still with you Woo Im still with you

                Uhm standing here in disarray A calm serenity The winds of change can devastate And it took this much for me With nowhere to run and No reason left to hide Gonna hold on All the walls around are broken down Now I can hear the rising sun Surrounded by everything I want But nothing that I need I was blinded by the absurdity Losing all identity Sometimes what you fear The most is what you need To find that road Right around that curve a lesson learned Now that I have the eyes to see A hurricane a hurricane Yeah is sometimes the only Way to wash away the pain A hurricane a hurricane Yeah is sometimes the only thing That brings you back again With poison toys Id isolate But the wind was strong and true But now I see where the treasure is Cause they only blocked my view Im spiraling down but so oblivious Got to find my way home Theres a heart that bleeds trapped in me But how do I break this shell of stone A hurricane a hurricane Yeah is sometimes the only way To wash away the pain A hurricane a hurricane A hurricane sometimes the only Thing that brings you back again yeah Sometimes I cried sometimes I cried The tears wouldnt fall And sometimes I tried Sometimes I tried to break those walls And feel your love But I came alive inside When I finally found my way hey woo Woo hoo hoo hee woo A hurricane a hurricane A hurricane yeah is sometimes the only Way to wash away the pain hey A hurricane a hurricane A hurricane sometimes the only Thing that brings you back again Uh hurricane a hurricane A hurricane is sometimes the only Way to wash away the pain A hurricane a hurricanewoo uh
