        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m drunk on your kiss&lt;br&gt;
for another night&lt;br&gt;
In a row&lt;br&gt;
this is becoming&lt;br&gt;
Too routine for me&lt;br&gt;
but I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to&lt;br&gt;
Lead you on&lt;br&gt;
and it&amp;rsquo;s alright to&lt;br&gt;
Pretend that&lt;br&gt;
we still talk&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s just for show&lt;br&gt;
isn&amp;rsquo;t it it&amp;rsquo;s my fault&lt;br&gt;
That it fell apart&lt;br&gt;
just maybe you need&lt;br&gt;
This and I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean&lt;br&gt;
to lead you on&lt;br&gt;
You were everything&lt;br&gt;
I wanted&lt;br&gt;
But I just can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
finish what I started&lt;br&gt;
Theres no room&lt;br&gt;
left here on my back&lt;br&gt;
It was damaged&lt;br&gt;
long ago&lt;br&gt;
Though you swear that&lt;br&gt;
you are true&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d still pick&lt;br&gt;
my friends over you&lt;br&gt;
My friends over you&lt;br&gt;
please tell me&lt;br&gt;
Everything&lt;br&gt;
that you think that&lt;br&gt;
I should know&lt;br&gt;
about all the plans&lt;br&gt;
You made&lt;br&gt;
when I was nowhere&lt;br&gt;
To be found&lt;br&gt;
and it&amp;rsquo;s alright&lt;br&gt;
To forget that&lt;br&gt;
we still talk&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s just for fun&lt;br&gt;
isn&amp;rsquo;t it it&amp;rsquo;s my fault&lt;br&gt;
Yhat it fell apart&lt;br&gt;
just maybe&lt;br&gt;
You need this&lt;br&gt;
and I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to&lt;br&gt;
Lead you on&lt;br&gt;
you were everything&lt;br&gt;
I wanted&lt;br&gt;
but I just can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
Finish what I started&lt;br&gt;
