&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A breathless drive on a downtown street,&lt;br&gt;
A motor-bike ride in the midday heat,&lt;br&gt;
The dust that hung from the desert skies,&lt;br&gt;
Run though we&amp;rsquo;d run it still burned our eyes,&lt;br&gt;
Oh yes we may walk on the wild wild side of life,&lt;br&gt;
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side,&lt;br&gt;
And in the shadows of a promise you can take my hand,&lt;br&gt;
And show me a way to understand.&lt;br&gt;
So if you think you know how to love me,&lt;br&gt;
And you think you know what I need,&lt;br&gt;
And if you really really want me to stay,&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve got to lead the way,&lt;br&gt;
Yes if you think you know how to love me,&lt;br&gt;
And you think you can stand by me,&lt;br&gt;
And if you really really want me to stat,&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve got to lead the way.&lt;br&gt;
A reckless nite in a nameless town,&lt;br&gt;
Then we moved out of sight with a silent sound,&lt;br&gt;
A beach that wept with deserted waves,&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s where we slept knowing we&amp;rsquo;d be safe,&lt;br&gt;
Now you may think you can walk on the wild,wild side with me,&lt;br&gt;
But there&amp;rsquo;s a lot I can learn and a lot that I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to see&lt;br&gt;
You know you&amp;rsquo;ve got my life lying in your hands,&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to make me understand.&lt;br&gt;
So if you think you know how to love me,&lt;br&gt;
And you think you know what I need,&lt;br&gt;
And if you really really want me to stay,&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve got to lead the way,&lt;br&gt;
Yes if you think you know how to love me,&lt;br&gt;
And you think you can stand by me,&lt;br&gt;
And if you really really want me to stay,&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve got to lead the way.&lt;/p&gt;
