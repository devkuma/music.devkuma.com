                When I hear that sound I know whats coming round Thirtynine degrees too hot for the bees The grass is turning yellow Streets are slow and mellow The faucet keeps on dripping And the clock it keeps on ticking The swimming pool is laughing With its shiny bright blue teeth Laughing at my body as Its sweltering with heat The smell of colored plastic Baking in the sun Sweet just like frustration My senses on the run I want your ice cream I want it lying in the sun I want your ice cream I want it melting on my tongue I want your ice cream I want it whatcha waiting for Ice cream every bite all I want is more Ice cream filling up the car The red door burns my thigh How is this place still standing With temperatures so high Air and ground so heavy Thick with gasoline My hands wont keep me steady Hotter than Ive ever been The swimming pool is laughing With its shiny bright blue teeth Laughing at my body as Its sweltering with heat The smell of colored plastic Baking in the sun Sweet just like frustration My senses on the run I want your ice cream I want it lying in the sun I want your ice cream I want it melting on my tongue I want your ice cream I want it whatcha waiting for Ice cream every bite all I want is more Ice cream you scream I want your ice cream I want it lying in the sun I want your ice cream I want it melting on my tongue I want your ice cream I want it lying in the sun I want your ice cream I want it melting on my tongue I want your ice cream I want it whatcha waiting for Ice cream every bite all I want is more
