        &lt;p&gt;작곡: Ant Saunders / 작사: Words &amp;amp; Music by&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=96892&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;96892&lt;/a&gt; / KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@TJKaraoke/search?query=79217&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;79217&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She put my name&lt;br&gt;
with yellow hearts&lt;br&gt;
Her favorite color&lt;br&gt;
like the stars&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen&lt;br&gt;
very hard&lt;br&gt;
When&lt;br&gt;
she told me&lt;br&gt;
She was crazy&lt;br&gt;
from the start&lt;br&gt;
She put my name&lt;br&gt;
with yellow hearts&lt;br&gt;
I said&lt;br&gt;
she was a work of art&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen&lt;br&gt;
very hard&lt;br&gt;
When&lt;br&gt;
she told me&lt;br&gt;
She was crazy&lt;br&gt;
from the start&lt;br&gt;
I drive down&lt;br&gt;
open roads so slow&lt;br&gt;
Here comes a train&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll let it go&lt;br&gt;
Ain&amp;rsquo;t got nobody&lt;br&gt;
on my phone&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t like being&lt;br&gt;
all alone&lt;br&gt;
Not good at keeping&lt;br&gt;
with the trends&lt;br&gt;
Too good&lt;br&gt;
at welcoming amends&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s been&lt;br&gt;
a while&lt;br&gt;
Since I&amp;rsquo;ve heard&lt;br&gt;
her say&lt;br&gt;
That we were&lt;br&gt;
more than friends&lt;br&gt;
Oh I I I I know&lt;br&gt;
a lot is going on&lt;br&gt;
But girl&lt;br&gt;
please tell me&lt;br&gt;
And&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll let you be&lt;br&gt;
Are you still&lt;br&gt;
with me or not&lt;br&gt;
She put my name&lt;br&gt;
with yellow hearts&lt;br&gt;
Her favorite color&lt;br&gt;
like the stars&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen&lt;br&gt;
very hard&lt;br&gt;
When&lt;br&gt;
she told me&lt;br&gt;
She was crazy&lt;br&gt;
from the start&lt;br&gt;
She put my name&lt;br&gt;
with yellow hearts&lt;br&gt;
I said&lt;br&gt;
she was a work of art&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen&lt;br&gt;
very hard&lt;br&gt;
When&lt;br&gt;
she told me&lt;br&gt;
She was crazy&lt;br&gt;
from the start&lt;br&gt;
She put yellow hearts&lt;br&gt;
around my name&lt;br&gt;
I thought they were&lt;br&gt;
all just the same&lt;br&gt;
To you what do they&lt;br&gt;
really mean&lt;br&gt;
Have you only been&lt;br&gt;
playing games&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m by the garden with&lt;br&gt;
the carpenter bees&lt;br&gt;
Like I&amp;rsquo;m Bob Ross-in&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
with a Harden beard&lt;br&gt;
Taking it&lt;br&gt;
all in like&lt;br&gt;
I got no issues&lt;br&gt;
in my nature&lt;br&gt;
Primroses blooming&lt;br&gt;
in the night&lt;br&gt;
Birds wanna take me&lt;br&gt;
on a flight&lt;br&gt;
Appreciating&lt;br&gt;
my land&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Fore it turns&lt;br&gt;
into a glacier&lt;br&gt;
Chasers are&lt;br&gt;
of no good use&lt;br&gt;
This taste will&lt;br&gt;
be long endured&lt;br&gt;
Why&amp;rsquo;d you have to go&lt;br&gt;
so soon&lt;br&gt;
I thought this was&lt;br&gt;
as good as new&lt;br&gt;
She put yellow hearts&lt;br&gt;
around my name&lt;br&gt;
I thought they were&lt;br&gt;
all just the same&lt;br&gt;
To you what do they&lt;br&gt;
really mean&lt;br&gt;
Have you only been&lt;br&gt;
playing games&lt;br&gt;
She put my name&lt;br&gt;
with yellow hearts&lt;br&gt;
Her favorite color&lt;br&gt;
like the stars&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen&lt;br&gt;
very hard&lt;br&gt;
When&lt;br&gt;
she told me&lt;br&gt;
She was crazy&lt;br&gt;
from the start&lt;br&gt;
She put my name&lt;br&gt;
with yellow hearts&lt;br&gt;
I said&lt;br&gt;
she was a work of art&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen&lt;br&gt;
very hard&lt;br&gt;
When&lt;br&gt;
she told me&lt;br&gt;
She was crazy&lt;br&gt;
from the start&lt;br&gt;
Have you only been&lt;br&gt;
playing games no no&lt;/p&gt;
