        &lt;p&gt;작사: Rikki Rockett, C.C. DeVille, Bobby Dall, Bret Michaels&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=61629&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;61629&lt;/a&gt; / KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@TJKaraoke/search?query=20886&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;20886&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both lie&lt;br&gt;
silently still&lt;br&gt;
In the dead&lt;br&gt;
of the night&lt;br&gt;
Although we both lie&lt;br&gt;
close together&lt;br&gt;
We feel miles&lt;br&gt;
apart inside&lt;br&gt;
Was it&lt;br&gt;
something I said&lt;br&gt;
Or something I did&lt;br&gt;
did my words not&lt;br&gt;
Come out right&lt;br&gt;
though I tried&lt;br&gt;
Not to hurt you&lt;br&gt;
though I tried&lt;br&gt;
But I guess&lt;br&gt;
that&amp;rsquo;s why they say&lt;br&gt;
Every rose&lt;br&gt;
has its thorn&lt;br&gt;
Just like every night&lt;br&gt;
has its dawn&lt;br&gt;
Just like every cowboy&lt;br&gt;
sings his sad sad song&lt;br&gt;
Every rose has its&lt;br&gt;
thorn yeah it does&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to&lt;br&gt;
our favorite song&lt;br&gt;
Playing on the radio&lt;br&gt;
hear the D J say&lt;br&gt;
Loves a game of&lt;br&gt;
easy come and easy go&lt;br&gt;
But I wonder&lt;br&gt;
does he know&lt;br&gt;
Has he ever&lt;br&gt;
felt like this&lt;br&gt;
And I know&lt;br&gt;
that you&amp;rsquo;d be here&lt;br&gt;
Right now&lt;br&gt;
if I could have&lt;br&gt;
Let you know somehow&lt;br&gt;
I guess&lt;br&gt;
Every rose&lt;br&gt;
has its thorn&lt;br&gt;
Just like every night&lt;br&gt;
has its dawn&lt;br&gt;
Just like every cowboy&lt;br&gt;
sings his sad sad song&lt;br&gt;
Every rose&lt;br&gt;
has its thorn&lt;br&gt;
Though it&amp;rsquo;s been&lt;br&gt;
a while now&lt;br&gt;
I can still feel&lt;br&gt;
so much pain&lt;br&gt;
Like a knife that cuts&lt;br&gt;
you the wound heals&lt;br&gt;
But the scar&lt;br&gt;
that scar remains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I could have&lt;br&gt;
saved a love&lt;br&gt;
That night&lt;br&gt;
if I&amp;rsquo;d known&lt;br&gt;
What to say&lt;br&gt;
instead of makin&amp;rsquo; love&lt;br&gt;
We both made&lt;br&gt;
our separate ways&lt;br&gt;
But now I hear&lt;br&gt;
you found somebody new&lt;br&gt;
And that I never meant&lt;br&gt;
that much to you&lt;br&gt;
To hear that&lt;br&gt;
tears me up inside&lt;br&gt;
And to see you cuts me&lt;br&gt;
like a knife I guess&lt;br&gt;
Every rose&lt;br&gt;
has its thorn&lt;br&gt;
Just like every night&lt;br&gt;
has its dawn&lt;br&gt;
Just like every cowboy&lt;br&gt;
sings his sad sad song&lt;br&gt;
Every rose&lt;br&gt;
has its thorn&lt;/p&gt;
