        &lt;p&gt;작곡: John Cameron, Claude.. / 작사: Words &amp;amp; Music by&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=79178&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;79178&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time&lt;br&gt;
when men were kind&lt;br&gt;
When their voices were&lt;br&gt;
soft&lt;br&gt;
And their words&lt;br&gt;
inviting&lt;br&gt;
There was a time&lt;br&gt;
when love was blind&lt;br&gt;
And the world&lt;br&gt;
was a song&lt;br&gt;
And the song was&lt;br&gt;
exciting&lt;br&gt;
There was a time&lt;br&gt;
then it all went wrong&lt;br&gt;
I dreamed a dream&lt;br&gt;
in times gone by&lt;br&gt;
When hope was high&lt;br&gt;
and life worth living&lt;br&gt;
I dreamed that love&lt;br&gt;
would never die&lt;br&gt;
I dreamed that God&lt;br&gt;
would be forgiving&lt;br&gt;
Then I was young&lt;br&gt;
and unafraid&lt;br&gt;
And dreams were made&lt;br&gt;
and used and wasted&lt;br&gt;
There was no ransom&lt;br&gt;
to be paid&lt;br&gt;
No song unsung&lt;br&gt;
no wine untasted&lt;br&gt;
But the tigers&lt;br&gt;
come at night&lt;br&gt;
With their voices soft&lt;br&gt;
as thunder&lt;br&gt;
As they tear&lt;br&gt;
your hope apart&lt;br&gt;
As they turn&lt;br&gt;
your dream to shame&lt;br&gt;
He slept a summer&lt;br&gt;
by my side&lt;br&gt;
He filled my days&lt;br&gt;
with endless wonder&lt;br&gt;
He took my childhood&lt;br&gt;
in his stride&lt;br&gt;
But he was gone&lt;br&gt;
when autumn came&lt;br&gt;
And still I dream&lt;br&gt;
he&amp;rsquo;ll come to me&lt;br&gt;
That we&amp;rsquo;ll live&lt;br&gt;
the years together&lt;br&gt;
But there are dreams&lt;br&gt;
that cannot be&lt;br&gt;
And there are storms&lt;br&gt;
we cannot weather&lt;br&gt;
I had a dream my life&lt;br&gt;
would be&lt;br&gt;
So different from this&lt;br&gt;
hell I&amp;rsquo;m living&lt;br&gt;
So different now&lt;br&gt;
from what it seemed&lt;br&gt;
Now life has killed&lt;br&gt;
the dream I dreamed&lt;/p&gt;
