        &lt;p&gt;작곡: Gilbert O&amp;rsquo;sullivan / 작사: Words &amp;amp; Music by&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=8015&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;8015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a little while&lt;br&gt;
from now&lt;br&gt;
If I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling&lt;br&gt;
any less sour&lt;br&gt;
I promise myself&lt;br&gt;
to treat myself and&lt;br&gt;
Visit a nearby tower&lt;br&gt;
and climbing&lt;br&gt;
To the top&lt;br&gt;
will throw myself off&lt;br&gt;
In an effort to make&lt;br&gt;
it clear to who ever&lt;br&gt;
What it&amp;rsquo;s like when&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;re shattered&lt;br&gt;
Left standing&lt;br&gt;
in the lurch&lt;br&gt;
At a church&lt;br&gt;
where people saying&lt;br&gt;
My god that&amp;rsquo;s tough&lt;br&gt;
she stood him up&lt;br&gt;
No point&lt;br&gt;
in us remaining&lt;br&gt;
We may as well go home&lt;br&gt;
as I did on my own&lt;br&gt;
Alone again naturally-&lt;br&gt;
to think&lt;br&gt;
That only yesterday&lt;br&gt;
I was cheerful&lt;br&gt;
Bright and gay&lt;br&gt;
looking forward to&lt;br&gt;
Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do&lt;br&gt;
the role&lt;br&gt;
I was about to play&lt;br&gt;
but as if to&lt;br&gt;
Knock me down&lt;br&gt;
reality came around&lt;br&gt;
And without so much&lt;br&gt;
as a mere touch&lt;br&gt;
Cut me into&lt;br&gt;
little pieces&lt;br&gt;
Leaving me to doubt&lt;br&gt;
talk about god&lt;br&gt;
In his mercy&lt;br&gt;
who if he really&lt;br&gt;
Does exist&lt;br&gt;
why did he desert me&lt;br&gt;
In my hour of need&lt;br&gt;
I trully am indeed&lt;br&gt;
Alone again naturally-&lt;br&gt;
it seems to me that&lt;br&gt;
There are more hearts&lt;br&gt;
broken in the world&lt;br&gt;
That can&amp;rsquo;t be mended&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
left unattend&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
What do we do&lt;br&gt;
what do we do-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alone again&lt;br&gt;
naturally-&lt;br&gt;
Looking back&lt;br&gt;
over the years-&lt;br&gt;
And whatever else&lt;br&gt;
that appears&lt;br&gt;
I remember I cried&lt;br&gt;
when my father died&lt;br&gt;
Never wishing to&lt;br&gt;
hide the tears&lt;br&gt;
And at sixty five&lt;br&gt;
years old&lt;br&gt;
My mother god rest&lt;br&gt;
her soul&lt;br&gt;
Couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand&lt;br&gt;
why the only man&lt;br&gt;
She had ever loved&lt;br&gt;
had been taken&lt;br&gt;
Leaving her to start&lt;br&gt;
with a heart&lt;br&gt;
So badly broken&lt;br&gt;
despite encouragement&lt;br&gt;
From me no words&lt;br&gt;
were ever spoken&lt;br&gt;
And when&lt;br&gt;
she passed away&lt;br&gt;
I cried&lt;br&gt;
and cried all day&lt;br&gt;
Alone again&lt;br&gt;
naturally-&lt;br&gt;
Alone again&lt;br&gt;
naturally-&lt;/p&gt;
