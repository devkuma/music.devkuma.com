                Im liable to start a violent spark With a silent thought I disgust you like dialogue From the shop to the wired frog Night club xhit I was taught If your CDs on fire You had to put it out yourself Like Highland Park no fire department So you might not hear sirens at all But dont be alarmed if I sound off Something just aint right with me dawg A martyr on a private charter Whose life could be harder Widely regarded highly bite me sweetheart Im slightly xetarded But tonight Im starting xhit Im feeling self righteous I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac xhit Looking to box with anybody Disorderly conduct Ill xuck around and snort a key And pick a fight with a locksmith Fan of the LOX bananas manic Im going in shock frantic Im trapped in a closet Panic attack cause Im claustrophobic no xaggot I mean I cant maneuver from movement Cause I have no room for improvement Im practically squashed Unpacked it and boxed it Toxic hands are arsenic Flammable bars examine the content Bar exam start of insanity Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson Animal snarls cannibal jaws Shark mandibles lambs to the slaughter Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking Anthony Hopkins with his hands In his pockets black out Zach Galifianakis gallons of vodka But that gal has some knockers I bet you they ring a bell When I come back and Im conscious What happened doc I passed out again Alcohols making me break into Vacants naked stole a magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Datsun Fell asleep watching Fear factor and scare tactics Too close to the StairMaster Poked a hole in the air Mattress and popped it woke up shortly Thereafter hungover no underwear grasping A Bayer Aspirin and dropped it Air Max in my closet preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich And the cross stitching is A cross mixing of a rhinoceros Possum skin giraffe and a dolphin Fin cotton Dockers OshKoshes Drop crotches Swatch watches And sneakers matches with the Parkers But its like being overstaffed At a boxing gym with all these trainers But I dont have any boxers And Im standing here naked Hangover still wasted like paper You write raps on obnoxious Yo why does it always sound Like Im grabbing my nostrils Xuck that Ill battle em all Ill battle a mall Ill stand there And yell that at a wall Until the mannequin doll Scatter and the inanimate objects That Im battering all shatter and fall Cause I hear the track And Im starting to get xucking amped Ima spark plug Im like the car With the cables hooked up To my xucking back Im a Duracell But I sure as hell got it backwards Cause yall could get jumped And Id catch the battery charge But I got a hunch like your back When its arching when I start attacking Your squadron youll feel like MasterCard when Im charging So take a swipe at me Im coming straight at you Like Clay Matthews From the Green Bay Packers So get the sack of Wisconsin Thats nutbag that Im talking Who am I kidding You xaggots are all gonna do my bidding Dont get dragged to the auction Neiman Marcus bags of Vuitton and all Ill push a xitch into oncoming traffic Just watch this stretched tinted Black sedan my xss see how mad you act When I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave In a xucking taxi cab to go shopping Affable guy next door is laughable My next whores gonna have mechanical arms Thatll jack me off With a lotion dispenser With a motion sensor no emotion Hence I guess this sick prick dies hard I got a Magic Johnson its like a magic wand Allows me to not let a blonde arouse me If Ronda Rousey was on the couch With the condoms out holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me Ill laugh in response to How she dances and flaunts it around me Her flat little xadonkadonk is Bouncing around and all I see is Paulie Malign now Shes slaughterhouse in a blouse And Madonna with mud on her Xoddammit I am misogynist I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster Throw her off a balcony Just so happens shes fond of algae Cause now shes faceplants On the concrete complete Lack of responsibility Half you xssholes aint strong enough To pick up a spirit xhit You xags couldnt shoplift At a thrift shop But I let the track lift em up Boost the energy klepto Im back to rip shop up But my thing is this now Fivefinger discount been rapping so long Ive been killing this xhit Its easy kidnapping your mom Cause Im still in this xitch thievery Ransom for JonBenet Ramsey Chandra Levy and Gary Condit Paul was scared That if I went back to the blonde I might relapse get on some bullxhit Perhaps Ill launch some cracker Taunts at action Bronson Macklemore Mac Miller and Asher Roth And have some back and forths And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamars control verse And perform fack in concert Yo I put that xhit On a greatest hits album Now that was awesome It takes some massive balls to Do some xhit like that Sometimes I have to ponder Why people are like Ill stick around And put up with my crap so long for Whats the attraction mama Is it the fact that Im a walking talking Actual quadruple entendre Or the pointy nose Thats pointing at you mama Who knows at this point Its always poking so meh Still get along with this voice Cause thats the monster So dosido with a sociopath Everyone who knows me knows that What they dont know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio meh She loves the way I lie Sits on my face and waits For my nose to grow pathological liar Oh why am I such an xsshole That my disguise is pants But they on fire so am I Cappadonna cut the track off Sabotage Christmas crap in your stocking Im wrapping up all the presents In xucking camouflage So you cant even find em Jack Santa Claus snap Rudolphs antlers off Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage And blind him blowing the head Gasket at bed bath and beyond Put the basket back while the bath salt Packets are gone I Know you really tired of me Sampling Billy Squier but classic rock Acid rap is the genre got slash on guitar Splashing bizarre thrasher and Aerosmith And Im a spectacular archer Feed count Dracula Chocula Godzilla half dragon and Bob Dylan Bandwagoners Im kicking the xamn Stragglers off and Im strangling em Smack Kim Basinger on a xss

                Im beginning to feel like a rap God rap God All my people from the front to the Back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long Enough to slap box slap box They said I rap like a robot So call me rapbot But for me to rap like a computer Must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My penll go off when I halfcock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a living and a killing off it Ever since Bill Clinton was Still in office with Monica Lewinsky Feeling on his nutsack Im an MC still as honest But as rude and indecent As all hell syllables killaholic Kill em all with This slickety gibbedy hibbedy hip hop You dont really wanna Get into a pissing match With this rappidy rap Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac Pack backpack rap yep yacketyyak The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts While Im practicing That Ill still be able to Break a motherxuckin table Over the back of a couple of xaggots And crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to aftermath After the fact how could I not blow All I do is drop Fbombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period Heres a maxipad Its actually disastrously bad For the wack while Im masterfully Constructing this masterpiece as Im beginning to feel like a rap God rap God All my people from the front to the Back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long Enough to slap box slap box Let me show you maintaining This shit aint that hard that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap Immortality like I have got Well to be truthful the blueprints Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the moon since MCs get taken to school with this music Cause I use it As a vehicle to bust a rhyme Now I lead a new school Full of students me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz 2Pac NWA Cube Hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy Thank you they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet Run DMC and induct them Into the motherxuckin Rock n roll Hall of Fame Even though I walk in the church And burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You xags think its all a game Til I walk a flock of flames Off of planking tell me What in the xuck are you thinking Little gay looking boy So gay I can barely say it With a straight face looking boy You witnessing a massacre Like you watching a church Gathering take place looking boy Oy vey that boys gay Thats all they say looking boy You get a thumbs up pat on the back And a way to go from your label Every day looking boy hey looking boy What you say looking boy I got a hell yeah from Dre looking boy Ima work for everything I have Never ask nobody for xhit Get outta my face looking boy Basically boy youre never gonna be capable To keep up with the same pace looking boy Cause Im beginning to Feel like a rap God rap God All my people from the front to the Back nod back nod The way Im racing around the track Call me NASCAR NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park The White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard So you be Thor and Ill be Odin You rodent Im omnipotent Let off then Im reloading Immediately with these bombs Im totin And I should not be woken Im the walking dead But Im just a talking head A zombie floating But I got your mom deep throating Im out my ramen noodle We have nothing in common poodle Im a doberman pinch yourself In the arm and pay homage pupil Its me my honestys brutal But its honestly futile If I dont utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle Enough rhymes to maybe to try And help get some people Through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me Like its lunchtime I know there was a time Where once I was king of the underground But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes But sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and Here they come trying to Censor you like that one line I said on Im back from the Mathers LP One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine Put em all in a line add an AK47 A revolver and a nine See if I get away with it now That I aint as big as I was but Ive Morphed into an immortal Coming through the portal Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I dont know what the xuck that you Rhyme for youre pointless As Rapunzel with xucking cornrows Youre like normal xuck being normal And I just bought a new Ray gun from the future To just come and shoot ya Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a xag At Maywhethers pad singin to a man While they played piano Man oh man that was a 247 Special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio Station the very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed JJ Faduh sama lamaa duma lamaa You assuming Im a human What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything You saying ricocheting off of me And itll glue to you Im never stating More than never demonstrating How to give a motherxuckin Audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know that The haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyd be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music You make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do When they get jealous they confuse it Its not hip hop its pop Cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on lose yourself and make em lose it I dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to use Let me know when it occurs to you While Im ripping any one of These verses diverse as you Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if youre half as nice at songs You can sacrifice virgins too uh School flunkie pill junky But look at the accolades The skills brung me full of myself But still hungry I bully myself Cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you ill When I speak in tongues But its still tongue in cheek xuck you Im drunk so Satan take the xucking wheel Im asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boys Still chunky but funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils Heres what they want from me They asking me to eliminate Some of the women hate But if you take into consideration The bitter hatred that I had Then you may be a little Patient and more Sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But xuck it Lifes handing you lemons Make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women How the xuck am I supposed to Bake them a cake then Dont mistake it for Satan Its a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas And take a vacation to trip a broad And make her fall on her face and Dont be a retard be a king think not Why be a king when you can be a God

                Somethins burnin I cant figure out what Its either lust or a cloud of dust Judgement is clouded must Just be the powder from the power of love But Im in somethin I dont know How to get out of Left my girl in the house alone Is that mysoon to be spouses moan And the further I walked allowed her I paused for a minute to make certain Thats what I heard Cuz after all this is her place So I gave her the benefit of the doubt Think I might be about Busta Busta The thoughts so scary yo that it hurts brace Hope it aint there we go yo Cuz my head already goes to worst case Scenario though in the first place But you confirmed my low end theory though Shouldve known when I made it All the way to third base And that was only the first date Coulda made it to home plate But you slid straight for the dome and dove Face first no you dont understand I dont do this for anyone ever Yeah that aint what they all say Ill say it You can suck a softball Through a straw used to be my fiance Til you sucked on Wayne Andre and Kanye Lebron Akon Jay Lil Jon Raekwon Mase Polow Tha Don Drake Dante Ross James Conway Kwame Guess Im gettin my goddamn Jigga on Cuz your name Im beyond sayin But xuck it Im movin on You women are all cray but Ill probably Always keep on playin the game of Love love la la la la la love She doesnt love me No she dont love me no more She hates my company Yeah she dont love me no more I tried to get her up out of my head As my bags hit the door She screamed she loves me Like she never did before And I told her go where you want and Go do what you want to do I dont care And I told her go where you want and Go do what you want to do I dont care I told that xitch Im a sucker for love Youre a sucker for dick Suckin dick in your mommas tub Til your granny walked in Told the stupid xigga to duck Under the water he drowned Like an abortion They booked you for manslaughter You beat the case and I called you Sherane is not available now Leave a message at the tone And Kendrick dont forget to buy Two pair of those expensive heels You little xuckin ferris wheel Xuckin spendin on me xuck you think We gon get married still Xuckin Mary had a little lamb This aint no fairy tale Fairy godmomma better tell you How I xuckin feel like you should Xuckin beat it or xuckin eat it While Im on my period Now have a blessed day Xitch you serious Im in the mirror With this look on my face curious Why you aint xuckin with me You cut me up a Caesarean You know I want you bad As a Benjamin Im delirious I want you bad as the head Shattered on George Zimmerman After the Dillinger hit em diligently And killin him His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem Thats analogy and metaphor for yah I should win a medal For all the ways I adore yah This is me talkin poetry Yeah I got some home trainin That aint what you like aint it What about if I was famous as Marshall Would you give fellatio In the carpool cops pull us over They just wanna know if you gargle singin I hope shes good enough Meanwhile youre chasin her Chlamydia couldnt even get rid of her Pity the fool that pity the fool in me Ima live with the game of Love love la la la la la love She doesnt love me No she dont love me no more She hates my company Yeah she dont love me no more I tried to get her up out of my head As my bags hit the door She screamed she loves me Like she never did before And I told her go where you want and Go do what you want to do I dont care And I told her go where you want and Go do what you want to do I dont care So needless to say Im feeling betrayed Snatched my house key off my keychain She jumped off WeeBey from The Wire escape Now shes chasin me with a cheese grater Here goes that broken record cliche Its all my fault anyway Shes turnin the tables Im a beat break Treats my face like seratos She cuts and scratches like a DJ Each day is an instant replay They sayin we display Cinethematic abatic behavior back together But forgot today was her bday Cut me off on the freeway Simple misunderstandin But just as I went to slam on the brakes Then I realized that She may be as crazy as me wait Xitch cut my xuckin brake line Stepped on them xuckers 8 times Still goin 73 thank God Theres an exit coming up But them other X U C Ks All wouldve hit the off ramp So I coast into a gosh Damned aww hit a xuckin tree Now here she comes at full speed Shes racin at me Okay You wanna xuck with me eh Snatch the xitch out her car Through the window she screamin I body slam her onto the cement Until the concrete Gave and created a sinkhole Bury this stink ho in it Then payed to have the street repaved Xuck woke up in a dream State in a cold sweat like I got hit With a freeze ray durin a heat wave Guess I eventually caved though Cause shes layin next to me in bed Directly aimin a gat at my head Woke up again and jumped up Like xuck it Ive had it Im checkin into rehab I confess Im a static addict I guess thats why Im so clingy Every girl Ive ever had either says I got to much baggage Or Im too xuckin dramatic Man what the xuck is the matter Im just a xucking romantic I xucking love you you xucking xitch Combative possessive in fact last time I was mad at an ex I actually set off a chain reaction A tragic event I said hit the road And after she left I sent that xitch a text I said be careful driving Dont read this and have a accident She glanced to look at it And wrecked too bad Thought we had a connect No sense dwelling makes Never been a more compelling case Than a model covered in LOreal and mace Who fell from grace Eleven stories for story telling But the whore was yelling rape So the vocal cords were swelling And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings face Still they swarm the gates And my fans making stakes To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace Unless youre Andrea Yates Dont ask me for a date Dont be late Well the sentiments great But wait then theres been a mistake You want an intimate date I wanna intimidate I have infinite hate in my blood Its mainly because of the game of Wait dinner at eight I have infinite hate in my blood Its mainly because of the game of Love love la la la la la love

                Feels like a close its coming to Xuck am I gonna do Its too late to start over This is the only thing I thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways To word the same old song Ever since I came a long From the day the song called Hi My Name Is dropped Started thinking my name was fault Cause any time things went wrong I was the one Who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent Of a modernday Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only Entertainment dog gangsta nah Courageous balls had to change my style They said Im way too soft And I sound like AZ Nas Out came the claws and the fangs Been out since then but up Until the instant that I went against it It was ingrained in me That I wouldnt amount to a xhit stain I thought no wonder I had to unlearn Everything my brain was taught Do I really belong In this game I pondered I just wanna play my part Should I make waves or not So back and forth in my brain The Tugowar wages on I dont wanna seem Ungrateful or disrespect The art form I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face Before you get made pissed off Keep pluggin its your only outlet And your only outfit so you know Theyre gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it Quick and make it ah feel like Ive already Said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing Different ways that rhyme What I really wanna say is If theres anyone else That can relate to my story Betcha feel the same way I felt when I was In the same place you are I was a afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out Afraid Id never be found I dont wanna go another round An angry mans power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house With tiptoed love Run out of excuses for everyone So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear the time is near Guts over fear I shed a tear For all the times I let you push me round And let you keep me down Now I got guts over fear Guts over fear Feels like a close its coming to Xuck am I gonna do Its too late to start over This is the only thing I thing I know I know what its like I was there once Single parents hate your appearance Did you struggle to find your place In this world and the pain spawns All the anger on but it wasnt Until I put the pain in songs Learned who to aim it on That I made a spark Started to spit hard as xhit Learned how to harness it While the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre xhit But the crazy part was soon as I stopped Saying I gave a xuck Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart To look at all the pain Ive caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone And the lights go out in that trailer park And the window is closing And theres nowhere else That I can go with flows And Im frozen cause theres no more Emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs That I make for fun So to the break of dawn Here I go recycling the same old song But Id rather make Not Afraid 2 Then another motharxuckin We Made You uh And I dont wanna seem indulgent When I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise Pray to God I just opened enough Eyes later on gave you the supplies And the tools to hopefully use Thatll make ya strong Enough to lift yourself up When you feel like I felt Cause I cant explain to yall How dang exhausted my legs felt Just havin to balance my xang self When on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you ma cuz that gave me the Strength to cuz Shadymania So when they empty that stadium Least I made it outta that house And a found a place in this world When the day was done So this is for every kid Who alls they ever did was dreamt of One day just getting accepted I represent him or her anyone similar You are the reason that I made this song And everything youre scared To say dont be afraid to say no more From this day forward Just let them xholes talk Take it with a grain of salt And eat their xuckin faces off The legend of the angry blonde Lives on through you When Im gone and to think I was a afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out Afraid Id never be found I dont wanna go another round An angry mans power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house With tiptoed love Run out of excuses for everyone So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear the time is near Guts over fear I shed a tear For all the times I let you push me round And let you keep me down Now I got guts over fear Guts over fear

                Its ok its ok Youre gonna make it anyway Sometimes I just feel like quittin I still might Why do I put up this fight why do I still write sometimes its hard Enough just dealin with real life Sometimes I wanna jump this stage And just kill mics and show these people What my level of skills like but Im still white sometimes I just hate life Somethin aint right hit the brake lights Case of this stage fright Drawin a blank like Oh it aint my fault breakin eyeballs My insides crawl And I clam up I just slam shut I just cant do it my whole manhoods Just been stripped Ive just been ripped So I must didnt get for the bust didnt Split man fuck this shit yo Im goin the fuck home World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 mile road Im a man Im a make a new plan Time for me to just stand up And travel new land time for me to Just take matters into my own hands Once Im over these tracks man Im a never look back And Im gone I know right where Im goin sorry mama Im grown I must travel alone aint gon follow No footsteps Im makin my own Only way that I know how to escape From this 8 mile road Walkin these train tracks Tryin to regain back the spirit I had fore I go back to the same crap To the same plant in the same pants Trynna chase rap gotta move asap Get a new plan mamas got a new man Poor little baby sister She dont understand Sits in front of the TV Buries her nose in her pad And just colors until the crayon Gets dull on her hand While she colors her big brother Her mother and dad Aint no tellin what really goes on In her little head Wish I could be the daddy That neither one of us had But I keep runnin from something I never wanted so bad Sometimes I get upset cause I aint blew up yet Its like I grew up But I aint grown me too Nuts yet dont gotta rep my step Dont got enough pep the pressures Too much man Im just trynna Do whats best and I try sit alone And I cry yo I wont tell No lie not a moment goes by That I dont pray to the sky Please Im

8 mile road You gotta live it to feel it You didnt you wouldnt get it Well see what the big deal is Why it wasnt it still is to be Walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits Its different its a certain Significance of certificate Of authenticity youd never even see But its everything to me Its my credibility youd never seen Heard smelled or met a real MC whose Incredible or on the same pedastal as me But yet Im still unsigned havin a Rough time sit on the porch with All my friends and kick dumb rhymes Go to work and serve MCs in the lunch line But when it comes crunch time where do My punch lines go who must I show to bust my flow where must I go who must I know Or am I just another crab in the bucket Cause I aint havin no luck With this little rabbit so fuck it Maybe I need a new outlet Im startin to doubt shit Im feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with I look like a bum Yo my clothes aint about shit At the salvation army trynna Salvage an outfit and its cold trynna Travel this road plus I feel like Im always stuck in this battlin mode My defenses are so up but One thing I dont want is pity From no one this city is no fun There is no sun and its so dark sometimes I feel like Im just bein Pulled apart from each one Of my limbs by each one of my friends Its enough to just make me wanna jump Outta my skin sometimes I feel like a robot Sometimes I just know not What Im doin I just blow my head Is a stove top I just explode the ghetto gets So hot sometimes my mouth just Overloads the acid I dont got But Ive learned its time for me To Uturn yo it only takes one time For me to get burned aint no fallin Or next time Im meet a new girl I can no longer play stupid or be immature I got every ingredient all I need is the courage like I already got the beat all I need is the words Got the urge suddenly its a surge Suddenly a new burst of energy Has occurred time to show These free world leaders a three And a third I am no longer scared now Im free as a bird then I turn and cross Over the median curve Hit the burbs and all you See is a blur of 8 mile road Im a man Im a make a new plan Time for me to just stand up And travel new land time for me to Just take matters into my own hands Once Im over these tracks Man Im a never look back And Im gone I know right where Im goin sorry mama Im grown I must travel alone aint gon follow No footsteps Im makin my own Only way that I know how to escape From this 8 mile road
