                Its over and done but the heartache Lives on inside and whos the one Youre clinging to instead of me tonight And where are you now now that I need you Tears on my pillow wherever you go Ill cry me a river that Leads to your ocean you never see me Fall apart in the words of A broken heart its just emotion Thats taken me over caught up In sorrow lost in my soul But if you dont come back Come home to me darling Dont you know theres nobody Left in this world to hold me tight Dont you know theres nobody Left in this world to kiss goodnight Goodnight goodnight Im there at your side Im part of all the things you are But youve got a part of someone else Youve got to find your shining star And where are you now now that I need you Tears on my pillow wherever you go Ill cry me a river that Leads to your ocean you never see me Fall apart in the words of A broken heart its just emotion Thats taken me over caught up in sorrow Lost in my soul but if you dont Come back come home to me darling Dont you know theres nobody Left in this world to hold me tight Nobody left in this world To kiss goodnight goodnight And where are you now now that I need you Tears on my pillow wherever you go Ill cry me a river that leads to your ocean you never see me Fall apart in the words of A broken heart its just emotion Thats taken me over caught up in sorrow Lost in my soul but if you dont Come back come home to me darling Nobody left in this world To hold me tight nobody left In this world to kiss goodnight Goodnight goodnight
