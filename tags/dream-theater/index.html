                Far in the distant future Beyond the pages of our time Coldblooded wicked tyrants Threaten the freedom of mankind Corruption lust and greed Define the new nobility Changing the course of history Across a vast North Empire Most people struggle to survive Living a meek existence While their secluded leader thrives We are living day to day Forced to bear the lions share People just dont have the time For music anymore And no one seems to care My friends have seen the chosen one Our quest for freedom has begun He will be the answer to our prayers There walks a god among us Whos seen the writing on the wall He is the revolution Hell be the one to save us all My brother Gabriel is all the hope we need Shining like a beacon in the night Sheperd of Ravenskill a reason to believe Music is the gift he brings The songbird stops to listen When he sings

                Just let me catch my breath Ive heard the promises Ive seen the mistakes Ive had my fair share of tough breaks I need a new voice a new law a new way Take the time reevaluate Its time to pick up the pieces Go back to square one I think its time for a change There is something that I feel To be something that is real I feel the heat within my mind And craft new changes with my eyes Giving freely wandering promises A place with decisions Ill fashion I wont waste another breath You can feel the waves coming on Its time to take the time Let them destroy you or carry you on Its time to take the time Youre fighting the weight of the world But no one can save you this time Close your eyes you can find all You need in your mind The unbroken spirit obscured and disquiet Finds clearness this trial demands And at the end of this day Sighs an anxious relief For the fortune lies still in his hands If theres a pensive fear A wasted year A man must learn to cope If his obsessions real Suppression that he feels Must turn to hope Life is no more assuring than love Its time to take the time There are no answers from voices above Its time to take the time Youre fighting the weight of the world And no one can save you this time Close your eyes you can find all You need in your mind I close my eyes And feel the water rise around me Drown the beat of time Let my senses fall away I can see much clearer now Im blind  You can feel the waves coming on Its time to take the time Let them destroy you or carry you on Its time to take the time Youre fighting the weight of the world But no one can save you this time Close your eyes you can find all You need in your mind Woo woo yeah  Find all you need in your mind If you take the time Find all you need in your mind If you take the time

                Morning comes too early And nighttime falls too late And sometimes all I want to do is wait The shadow Ive been hiding in Has fled from me today I know its easier to walk away Than look it in the eye But I will raise a shelter to the sky And here beneath this star Tonight Ill lie She will slowly Yield the light as I awaken From the longest night  Dreams are shaking set sirens Waking up tired eyes with the light The memories all rush into his head By a candle stands a mirror of his heart And soul she dances she was dancing Thru the night above his bed And walking to the window He throws the shutters out Against the wall and from An ivory tower hears her call Let light surround you Its been a long long time Hes had a while to think it over In the end he only sees the change Light to dark dark to light Light to dark dark to light Heaven must be more than this When angels waken with a kiss Sacred hearts wont take the pain But mine will never be the same He stands before the window His shadow slowly fading from the wall And from an ivory tower hears her call Let the light surround you  Once lost but I was found When I heard the stained Glass shatter all around me I sent the spirits tumbling Down the hill but I will hold This one on high above me still She whispers words to clear my mind I once could see but now at last Im blind I know its easier to walk away Than look it in the eye But I had given all that I could take And now Ive only habits left to break Tonight Ill still be lying here Surrounded in all the light
