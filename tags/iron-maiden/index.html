                I left alone my mind was blank I needed time to think to get the Memories from my mind What did I see can I believe That what I saw that night was real And not just fantasy Just what I saw in my old dreams Were they reflections of my warped mind Staring back at me Cos in my dreams its always there The evil face that twists my mind And brings me to despair  The night was black Was no use holding back Cos I just had to see Was someone watching me In the mist dark figures move and twist Was all this for real Or just some kind of hell 666 the number of the beast Hell and fire was spawned to be released Torches blazed and sacred Chants were praised As they start to cry Hands held to the sky In the night the fires burning bright The ritual has begun Satans work is done 666 the number of the beast Sacrifice is going on tonight  This cant go on I must inform the law Can this still be real Or just some crazy dream But I feel drawn towards The evil chanting hordes They seem to mesmerise me Cant avoid their eyes 666 the number of the beast 666 the one for you and me Im coming back I will return And Ill possess your body And Ill make you burn I have the fire I have the force I have the power to make My evil take its course

                Youll take my life But Ill take yours too Youll fire your musket But Ill run you through So when youre waiting for the next attack Youd better stand Theres no turning back The bugle sounds and the charge begins But on this battlefield No one wins the smell of Acrid smoke and horses breath As I plunge on into certain death oh oh  The horse he sweats with fear We break to run The mighty roar of the Russian guns And as we race towards the human wall The screams of pain as my comrades fall We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground And the Russians fire another round We get so near yet so far away We wont live to fight another day oh oh  We get so close near enough to fight When a Russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow A burst of rounds take my horse below And as I lay there gazing at the sky My bodys numb and my throat is dry And as I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear I draw My parting groan oh oh
