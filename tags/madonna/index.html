                A long long time ago I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew that if I had my chance I could make those people dance And maybe theyd be happy for a while  Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the bible tells you so Now do you believe in RockN Roll And can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow Well I know that youre in love With him cause I saw You dancin in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man I did those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage bronc in buck With a pink carnation and a pick up truck But I knew that I was out of luck the day The music died I started singin Bye bye Miss American pie Drove my chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good ole boys were drinkin Whiskey and rye singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away Then I went down to this sacred store Where I heard the music years before But the man there said the music Wouldnt play well now In the streets the children screamed The lovers cry and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admired the most The father son and the holy ghost They caught the last train For the coast the day The music died we started singin Bye bye Miss American pie Drove my chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good ole boys were drinkin Whiskey and rye singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die  Bye bye Miss American pie Drove my chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good ole boys were drinkin Whiskey and rye singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die We started singin we started singin We started singin we started singin
