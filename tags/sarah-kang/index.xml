&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/G03KNr5EgpM&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time I would like my name&lt;br&gt;
Just because of the way you say it&lt;br&gt;
And I would memorize every line and hair&lt;br&gt;
To remember when you aren&amp;rsquo;t there&lt;br&gt;
We would walk along a tree-lined street&lt;br&gt;
With a breeze dancing at our feet&lt;br&gt;
And we would sing a song in harmony&lt;br&gt;
If only you hadn&amp;rsquo;t left me&lt;br&gt;
So I&amp;rsquo;ll think of you once in a moon&lt;br&gt;
When I hear your favorite tune&lt;br&gt;
And someday after a year or two&lt;br&gt;
Maybe then I won&amp;rsquo;t be loving you&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll think of you once in a moon&lt;br&gt;
When I see someone who looks like you&lt;br&gt;
And someday after a year or two&lt;br&gt;
Maybe then I&amp;rsquo;ll still be loving you&lt;br&gt;
We would say goodbye just to say hello again&lt;br&gt;
And we would get in fights just to get over them&lt;br&gt;
We would be alright&lt;br&gt;
even if things don&amp;rsquo;t stay the same&lt;br&gt;
If only you had stayed&lt;br&gt;
So I&amp;rsquo;ll think of you once in a moon&lt;br&gt;
When I hear your favorite tune&lt;br&gt;
And someday after a year or two&lt;br&gt;
Maybe then I won&amp;rsquo;t be loving you&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll think of you once in a moon&lt;br&gt;
When I see someone who looks like you&lt;br&gt;
And someday after a year or two&lt;br&gt;
Maybe then I&amp;rsquo;ll still be loving you&lt;br&gt;
What if I had bit my tongue&lt;br&gt;
What if what we had was enough&lt;br&gt;
I guess all my calculations were off&lt;br&gt;
When I thought I would get over you&lt;br&gt;
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense&lt;br&gt;
But I&amp;rsquo;d do it all again&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll think of you once in a moon&lt;br&gt;
When I hear your favorite tune&lt;br&gt;
And someday after a year or two&lt;br&gt;
Maybe then I won&amp;rsquo;t be loving you&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll think of you once in a moon&lt;br&gt;
When I see someone who looks like you&lt;br&gt;
And someday after a year or two&lt;br&gt;
Maybe then I&amp;rsquo;ll still be loving you&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I thought we&amp;rsquo;d have a long time&lt;br&gt;
So I let the weeks go by&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that I missed u&lt;br&gt;
That day when you came through&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the last time&lt;br&gt;
Would be our last goodbye&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that I missed u&lt;br&gt;
When you called me last June&lt;br&gt;
But now that I&amp;rsquo;ve lost you&lt;br&gt;
I tried to forget you&lt;br&gt;
And all that we&amp;rsquo;ve been through&lt;br&gt;
Been through&lt;br&gt;
But there is no use&lt;br&gt;
If I&amp;rsquo;ll always love you&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll let myself miss u&lt;br&gt;
Miss u&lt;br&gt;
You never did waste your time&lt;br&gt;
You were always on the next flight&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s almost like you already knew&lt;br&gt;
Since the day you turned 22&lt;br&gt;
You always gave me that smile&lt;br&gt;
Even if it had been a while&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that I missed you&lt;br&gt;
When you asked &amp;lsquo;Are you coming through?&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
But now that I&amp;rsquo;ve lost you&lt;br&gt;
I tried to forget you&lt;br&gt;
And all that we&amp;rsquo;ve been through&lt;br&gt;
Been through&lt;br&gt;
But there is no use&lt;br&gt;
If I&amp;rsquo;ll always love you&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll let myself miss u&lt;br&gt;
Miss u&lt;br&gt;
If I had known then&lt;br&gt;
I won&amp;rsquo;t see you again&lt;br&gt;
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have missed u&lt;br&gt;
Missed u&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll hold onto regrets&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Til I see you again&lt;br&gt;
All I can do is miss u&lt;br&gt;
Miss u&lt;br&gt;
If I had known then&lt;br&gt;
I won&amp;rsquo;t see you again&lt;br&gt;
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have missed u&lt;br&gt;
Missed u&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll hold onto regrets&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Til I see you again&lt;br&gt;
All I can do is miss u&lt;br&gt;
Miss u&lt;/p&gt;
