&lt;p&gt;If God had a name&lt;br&gt;
what would it be&lt;br&gt;
And would you call it&lt;br&gt;
to his face&lt;br&gt;
If you were&lt;br&gt;
faced with him&lt;br&gt;
In all his glory&lt;br&gt;
what would you ask&lt;br&gt;
If you had&lt;br&gt;
just one question&lt;br&gt;
And yeah yeah&lt;br&gt;
God is great&lt;br&gt;
Yeah yeah&lt;br&gt;
God is good&lt;br&gt;
Yeah yeah&lt;br&gt;

What if God was&lt;br&gt;
one of us&lt;br&gt;
Just a slob like&lt;br&gt;
one of us&lt;br&gt;
Just a stranger&lt;br&gt;
on the bus&lt;br&gt;
Trying to make&lt;br&gt;
his way home&lt;br&gt;
If God had a face what&lt;br&gt;
would it look like&lt;br&gt;
And would you want&lt;br&gt;
to see&lt;br&gt;
If seeing meant&lt;br&gt;
that&lt;br&gt;
You would have&lt;br&gt;
to believe&lt;br&gt;
In things&lt;br&gt;
like heaven&lt;br&gt;
And in Jesus&lt;br&gt;
and the saints&lt;br&gt;
And all&lt;br&gt;
the Prophets&lt;br&gt;
And yeah yeah&lt;br&gt;
God is great&lt;br&gt;
Yeah yeah&lt;br&gt;
God is good&lt;br&gt;
Yeah yeah&lt;br&gt;
yeah yeah yeah&lt;br&gt;
What if God was&lt;br&gt;
one of us&lt;br&gt;
Just a slob like&lt;br&gt;
one of us&lt;br&gt;
Just a stranger&lt;br&gt;
on the bus&lt;br&gt;
Trying to make&lt;br&gt;
his way home&lt;br&gt;
Trying to make&lt;br&gt;
his way home&lt;br&gt;
Back up to heaven&lt;br&gt;
all alone&lt;br&gt;
Nobody callin&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
on the phone&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cept for the Pope&lt;br&gt;
maybe in Rome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah yeah&lt;br&gt;

Just a slob like&lt;br&gt;
one of us&lt;br&gt;
Just a stranger&lt;br&gt;
on the bus&lt;br&gt;
Trying to make&lt;br&gt;
his way home&lt;br&gt;
Just trying to make&lt;br&gt;
his way home&lt;br&gt;
Like a holy&lt;br&gt;
rolling stone&lt;br&gt;
Back up to heaven&lt;br&gt;
all alone&lt;br&gt;
Just trying to make&lt;br&gt;
his way home&lt;br&gt;
Nobody callin&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
on the phone&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cept for the Pope&lt;br&gt;
