        &lt;p&gt;Hey girl you know&lt;br&gt;
you drive me crazy&lt;br&gt;
One look puts&lt;br&gt;
the rhythm in my head&lt;br&gt;
Still I&amp;rsquo;ll never&lt;br&gt;
understand&lt;br&gt;
Why you&lt;br&gt;
hang around&lt;br&gt;
I see&lt;br&gt;
what&amp;rsquo;s going down&lt;br&gt;
Cover up with makeup&lt;br&gt;
in the mirror&lt;br&gt;
Tell&lt;br&gt;
yourself&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s never gonna&lt;br&gt;
happen again&lt;br&gt;
You cry alone and then&lt;br&gt;
he swears he loves you&lt;br&gt;
Do you feel&lt;br&gt;
like a man&lt;br&gt;
When you&lt;br&gt;
push her around?&lt;br&gt;
Do you feel&lt;br&gt;
better now&lt;br&gt;
As she falls&lt;br&gt;
to the ground?&lt;br&gt;
Well I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you&lt;br&gt;
my friend&lt;br&gt;
One day this world&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
going to end&lt;br&gt;
As your lies&lt;br&gt;
crumble down&lt;br&gt;
A new life&lt;br&gt;
she has found&lt;br&gt;
A pebble in the water&lt;br&gt;
makes a ripple effect&lt;br&gt;
Every action&lt;br&gt;
in this world&lt;br&gt;
Will bear&lt;br&gt;
a consequence&lt;br&gt;
If you wade&lt;br&gt;
around forever&lt;br&gt;
You will&lt;br&gt;
surely drown&lt;br&gt;
I see&lt;br&gt;
what&amp;rsquo;s going down&lt;br&gt;
I see&lt;br&gt;
the way you go and&lt;br&gt;
Say you&amp;rsquo;re&lt;br&gt;
right again&lt;br&gt;
Say you&amp;rsquo;re right again&lt;br&gt;
heed my lecture&lt;br&gt;
Do you feel&lt;br&gt;
like a man&lt;br&gt;
When you&lt;br&gt;
push her around?&lt;br&gt;
Do you feel&lt;br&gt;
better now&lt;br&gt;
As she falls&lt;br&gt;
to the ground?&lt;br&gt;
Well I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you&lt;br&gt;
my friend&lt;br&gt;
One day this world&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
going to end&lt;br&gt;
As your lies&lt;br&gt;
crumble down&lt;br&gt;
A new life&lt;br&gt;
she has found&lt;br&gt;
Face down&lt;br&gt;
in the dirt&lt;br&gt;
She said&lt;br&gt;
this doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt&lt;br&gt;
She said&lt;br&gt;
I finally had enough&lt;br&gt;
Face down&lt;br&gt;
in the dirt&lt;br&gt;
She said&lt;br&gt;
this doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt&lt;br&gt;
She said&lt;br&gt;
I finally had enough&lt;br&gt;
One day&lt;br&gt;
she will tell you&lt;br&gt;
That she&lt;br&gt;
had enough&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s coming&lt;br&gt;
round again&lt;br&gt;
Do you feel&lt;br&gt;
like a man&lt;br&gt;
When you&lt;br&gt;
push her around?&lt;br&gt;
Do you feel&lt;br&gt;
better now&lt;br&gt;
As she falls&lt;br&gt;
to the ground?&lt;br&gt;
Well I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you&lt;br&gt;
my friend&lt;br&gt;
One day this world&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
going to end&lt;br&gt;
As your lies&lt;br&gt;
crumble down&lt;br&gt;
A new life&lt;br&gt;
she has found&lt;br&gt;
Do you feel&lt;br&gt;
like a man&lt;br&gt;
When you&lt;br&gt;
push her around?&lt;br&gt;
Do you feel&lt;br&gt;
better now&lt;br&gt;
As she falls&lt;br&gt;
to the ground?&lt;br&gt;
Well I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you&lt;br&gt;
my friend&lt;br&gt;
One day this world&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
going to end&lt;br&gt;
As your lies&lt;br&gt;
crumble down&lt;br&gt;
A new life&lt;br&gt;
she has found&lt;br&gt;
Face down&lt;br&gt;
in the dirt&lt;br&gt;
She said&lt;br&gt;
this doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt&lt;br&gt;
She said&lt;br&gt;
I finally had enough&lt;/p&gt;
