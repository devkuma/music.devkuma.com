                There was a girl I used to know She was oh so beautiful But shes not here anymore She had a college degree Smart as anyone could be Had so much to live for But she fell in love With the wrong kinda man He abused her love and treated her so bad There was not enough education in her world That could save the life Of this little girl How come how long Its not right its so wrong Do we let it just go on Turn our backs and carry on Wake up for its too late Right now we cant wait She wont have a second try Open up your hearts as well as your eyes She tried to give a cry for help She even blamed things on herself But no one came to her aid Nothing was wrong As far as we could tell Thats what wed like to tell ourselves But no it wasnt that way So she fell in love With the wrong kinda man And she paid with her life For loving that man So we cannot ignore We must look for the signs And maybe next time We might save somebodys life How come how long Its not right its so wrong Do we let it just go on Turn our backs and carry on Wake up for its too late Right now we cant wait She wont have a second try Open up your hearts as well as your eyes  I on occasion met that guy He stirred up feelings deep inside Some about him wasnt right The way he proves himself a man By beatin his woman with his hands Oh I wish that shed seen the light How can someone like that Call himself a man In reality hes far more less than that And we cannot ignore Whenever we see the signs Cause any kinda of abuse God knows isnt right How come how long Its not right its so wrong Do we let it just go on Turn our backs and carry on Wake up for its too late Right now we cant wait She wont have a second try Open up your hearts as well as your eyes
