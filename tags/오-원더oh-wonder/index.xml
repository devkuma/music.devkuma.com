        &lt;p&gt;Holy look at all this light that I give you&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re shining like the top of a tower&lt;br&gt;
Holy look at all this life that you give me&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m shining like I found all my power&lt;br&gt;
When we go we go out dancing&lt;br&gt;
Move heaven and earth&lt;br&gt;
Spin around like we are endless&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ve got too much love&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Too much love too much love&lt;br&gt;
You and me together&lt;br&gt;
Together till the end&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Holy body full of buzz when you&amp;rsquo;re in view&lt;br&gt;
Adoring you a million an hour&lt;br&gt;
Holy look at all this happiness come through&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m flying like a bee to a flower&lt;br&gt;
So can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ve got too much love&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Too much love too much love&lt;br&gt;
You and me together&lt;br&gt;
Together till the end&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause in a world of plenty of people&lt;br&gt;
There is no one else&lt;br&gt;
So can we always be you and me?&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ve got too much love&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Too much love too much love&lt;br&gt;
You and me together&lt;br&gt;
Together till the end&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
we got too much too much too much&lt;br&gt;
we got too much love&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;br&gt;
Can we always be friends?&lt;/p&gt;
