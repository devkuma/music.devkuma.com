                Look at your young men fighting Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying The way theyve always done before  Look at the hate were breeding Look at the fear were feeding Look at the lives were leading The way weve always done before My hands are tied The billions shift from side to side And the wars go on with brainwashed pride For the love of God and our human rights And all these things are swept aside By bloody hands time cant deny And are washed away by your genocide And history hides the lies of our civil wars  Dyou wear a black armband When they shot the man who said Peace could last forever And in my first memories They shot Kennedy I went numb When I learned to see so I never Fell for Vietnam we got The wall of DC to remind us all That you cant trust freedom When its not in your hands When everybodys fightin For their promised land And I dont need your civil war It feeds the rich while it buries The poor youre power hungry Sellin soldiers in a human Grocery store aint that fresh I dont need your civil war  Look at the shoes youre filling Look at the blood were spilling Look at the world were killing The way weve always done before Look in the doubt weve wallowed Look at the leaders weve followed Look at the lies weve swallowed And I dont want to hear no more My hands are tied For all Ive seen has changed my mind But still the wars go on And the years go by with no love of God Or human rights cause all these dreams Are swept aside by bloody hands Of the hypnotized who carry the cross Of homicide and history bears The scars of our civil wars  I dont need your civil war It feeds the rich while it buries The poor youre power hungry Sellin soldiers in a human Grocery store aint that fresh And I dont need your civil war I dont need your civil war I dont need your civil war Youre power hungry sellin soldiers In a human grocery store aint that fresh I dont need your civil war I dont need one more war  I dont need one more war
