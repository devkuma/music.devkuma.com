                Thought I ran into you down On the street then it turned out To only be a dream I made a point to burn all Of the photographs she went away And then I took a different path I remember the face But I cant recall the name Now I wonder how whatsername has been  Seems that she disappeared Without a trace Did she ever marry old whats his face I made a point to burn all Of the photographs she went away And then I took a different path I remember the face But I cant recall the name Now I wonder how whatsername has been  Remember whatever It seems like forever ago Remember whatever It seems like forever ago The regrets are useless in my mind Shes in my head I must confess The regrets are useless in my mind Shes in my head so long ago Ago ago ago ago ago ago ago ago ago And in the darkest night If my memory serves me right Ill never turn back time Forgetting you but not the time
