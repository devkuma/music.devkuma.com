        &lt;p&gt;It is your&lt;br&gt;
new best friend&lt;br&gt;
New eye in your&lt;br&gt;
private den&lt;br&gt;
And you can find&lt;br&gt;
the world inside it&lt;br&gt;
Every day&lt;br&gt;
they know what you&lt;br&gt;
Did today hear&lt;br&gt;
everything you say&lt;br&gt;
And when they&lt;br&gt;
send you mail&lt;br&gt;
They know&lt;br&gt;
where you will go&lt;br&gt;
Sometime next year&lt;br&gt;
they know your life&lt;br&gt;
They have file&lt;br&gt;
about you&lt;br&gt;
They built your life&lt;br&gt;
so they&lt;br&gt;
Know what you&lt;br&gt;
like and&lt;br&gt;
Know what you yearn&lt;br&gt;
but they don&amp;rsquo;t know a&lt;br&gt;
Thing about me&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not that easy&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m blank file&lt;br&gt;
in their memory&lt;br&gt;
Caught in the&lt;br&gt;
web again&lt;br&gt;
Inside your&lt;br&gt;
private den&lt;br&gt;
Where you can&lt;br&gt;
go to moon&lt;br&gt;
Or meet some people&lt;br&gt;
you will never see&lt;br&gt;
You are a&lt;br&gt;
file in there&lt;br&gt;
Money in&lt;br&gt;
an open fair&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re a slave&lt;br&gt;
among the slaves&lt;br&gt;
Waiting for Y2K&lt;br&gt;
with a fear&lt;br&gt;
They know your life&lt;br&gt;
they have file&lt;br&gt;
About you&lt;br&gt;
they built your life&lt;br&gt;
So they&lt;br&gt;
know what you like and&lt;br&gt;
Know what you yearn&lt;br&gt;
but they don&amp;rsquo;t know a&lt;br&gt;
Thing about me&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not that easy&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m blank file&lt;br&gt;
in their memory&lt;br&gt;
Still they&lt;br&gt;
try to take over&lt;br&gt;
Control my life&lt;br&gt;
but no one can do it&lt;br&gt;
But me&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not that easy&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m blank file&lt;br&gt;
in their memory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know what you like and&lt;br&gt;
know what you yearn&lt;br&gt;
But they don&amp;rsquo;t know a&lt;br&gt;
thing about me&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not that easy&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m blank file&lt;br&gt;
In their memory&lt;br&gt;
I am waiting&lt;br&gt;
Hoping and praying&lt;br&gt;
to see how this&lt;br&gt;
Will end&lt;br&gt;
when they go down&lt;br&gt;
How can it be&lt;br&gt;
that you cannot see&lt;br&gt;
What they are&lt;br&gt;
doing with thee&lt;br&gt;
You are a life&lt;br&gt;
new file&lt;br&gt;
In their memory&lt;br&gt;
now they&lt;br&gt;
Know what you like and&lt;br&gt;
know what you yearn&lt;br&gt;
But they don&amp;rsquo;t know a&lt;br&gt;
thing about me&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not that easy&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m blank file&lt;br&gt;
In their&lt;br&gt;
memory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can it be&lt;br&gt;
that you cannot see&lt;br&gt;
what they are&lt;br&gt;
doing with thee&lt;br&gt;
Spending you time&lt;br&gt;
living your life&lt;br&gt;
Inside their machines&lt;br&gt;
there is&lt;br&gt;
One empty file&lt;br&gt;
it is me&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Sitting on a corner&lt;br&gt;
all alone&lt;br&gt;
Staring from the&lt;br&gt;
bottom of his soul&lt;br&gt;
Watching the night&lt;br&gt;
come in from the&lt;br&gt;
Window window&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;ll all collapse&lt;br&gt;
Tonight the fullmoon&lt;br&gt;
is here again&lt;br&gt;
In sickness and&lt;br&gt;
in health&lt;br&gt;
Understanding&lt;br&gt;
so demanding&lt;br&gt;
It has no name&lt;br&gt;
there&amp;rsquo;s one for every&lt;br&gt;
Season makes him&lt;br&gt;
insane to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running away from it&lt;br&gt;
all I&amp;rsquo;ll be safe&lt;br&gt;
In the cornfields&lt;br&gt;
he thinks hunted&lt;br&gt;
By his own again&lt;br&gt;
he feels the moon&lt;br&gt;
Rising on the sky&lt;br&gt;
find a barn which to&lt;br&gt;
Sleep in but can&lt;br&gt;
he hide anymore&lt;br&gt;
Someones at the door&lt;br&gt;
understanding&lt;br&gt;
Too demanding&lt;br&gt;
can this be wrong&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s love that&lt;br&gt;
is not ending&lt;br&gt;
Makes him&lt;br&gt;
insane to know&lt;br&gt;
She should not lock&lt;br&gt;
the open door&lt;br&gt;
(Run away run&lt;br&gt;
away run away)&lt;br&gt;
Fullmoon is on the sky&lt;br&gt;
and he&amp;rsquo;s not&lt;br&gt;
A man anymore&lt;br&gt;
she sees the change&lt;br&gt;
In him but can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
(run away run&lt;br&gt;
Away run away)&lt;br&gt;
see what became out of&lt;br&gt;
Her man fullmoon&lt;br&gt;
swimming across&lt;br&gt;
The bay the nite is&lt;br&gt;
gray so calm today&lt;br&gt;
She doesn&amp;rsquo;t wanna wait&lt;br&gt;
we&amp;rsquo;ve gotta make&lt;br&gt;
The love complete&lt;br&gt;
tonight&lt;br&gt;
In the mist of the&lt;br&gt;
morning he cannot&lt;br&gt;
Fight anymore&lt;br&gt;
thousand moons or more&lt;br&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;s been howling&lt;br&gt;
knock on the door and&lt;br&gt;
Scream that is soon&lt;br&gt;
ending Mess&lt;br&gt;
On the floor again&lt;br&gt;
she should not lock&lt;br&gt;
The open door&lt;br&gt;
(run away run&lt;br&gt;
Away run away)&lt;br&gt;
fullmoon is on the sky&lt;br&gt;
And he&amp;rsquo;s not&lt;br&gt;
a man anymore&lt;br&gt;
She sees the change&lt;br&gt;
in Him but can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
(Run away run&lt;br&gt;
away run away)&lt;br&gt;
See what became&lt;br&gt;
out of her man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She should not lock&lt;br&gt;
the open door&lt;br&gt;
(Run away run&lt;br&gt;
away run away)&lt;br&gt;
Fullmoon is on the sky&lt;br&gt;
and He&amp;rsquo;s not&lt;br&gt;
A man anymore&lt;br&gt;
she sees the change in&lt;br&gt;
Him but can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
(run away run&lt;br&gt;
Away run away)&lt;br&gt;
see what became&lt;br&gt;
Out of her man&lt;br&gt;
see should not lock&lt;br&gt;
The open door&lt;br&gt;
(run away run&lt;br&gt;
Away run away)&lt;br&gt;
fullmoon is&lt;br&gt;
On the sky and He&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
not a man anymore&lt;br&gt;
Uh who See what became&lt;br&gt;
out of that man&lt;/p&gt;
