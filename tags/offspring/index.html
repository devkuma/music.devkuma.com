                When we were young The future was so bright The old neighborhood was so alive And every kid on the whole damn street Was gonna make it big and not be beat Now the neighborhoods cracked and torn The kids are grown up But their lives are worn How can one little street Swallow so many lives Chances thrown nothings free Longing for what used to be Still its hard hard to see Fragile lives shattered dreams go  Jamie had a chance well she really did Instead she dropped out And had a couple of kids Mark still lives at home Cause hes got no job he just plays guitar And smokes a lot of pot Jay committed suicide Brandon ODd and died What the hell is going on The cruelest dream reality Chances thrown nothings free Longing for what used to be Still its hard hard to see Fragile lives shattered dreams go  Chances thrown nothings free Longing for what used to be Still its hard hard to see Fragile lives shattered dreams
