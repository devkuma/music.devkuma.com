                Out in the shiny night the rain Was softly falling the tracks That ran down the bouleward Had all been washed away Out of the silver light The past came softly calling And I remembered the time We spent inside the sad cafe Oh it seemed like a holy place Protected by amazing grace And we would sing right out loud The things we could not say We thought we could change This world with words like love and freedom We were part of the lonely Crowed inside the sad cafe Oh expecting to fly We would meet on that beautiful shore In the sweet by and by Some of their dreams came true Some just passed away And some of them stayed behind Inside the sad cafe  The cloude rolled in and hid that shore Now that glory train it dont stop Here no more now I look at The years gone by and wonder At the power that be I dont know why Fortune smile on some and lets The rest go free maybe the time Has drawn the faces I recall But thing in this life change Very slowly if they ever change at all Theres no use in asking Why it just turned out that way So meet me at midnight baby Inside the sad cafe why dont you meet me At midnight baby inside the sad cafe

                Desperado why dont you come to Your senses youve been out Ridin fences for so long now Oh youre a hard one but I know that Youve got your reasons These things that are pleasin You can hurt you somehow Dont you draw the Queen of diamonds Boy shell beat you if shes able You know the Queen of hearts Is always your best bet Now it seems to me some fine things Have been laid upon your table But you only want the ones You cant get desperado Oh you aint gettin no younger Your pain and your hunger Theyre drivin you home And freedom oh freedom Well thats just some people talkin Your prison is walking through This world all alone dont you Feet get cold in the wintertime The sky wont snow and the sun Wont shine its hard to tell The night time from the day And youre losin all your highs and lows Aint it funny how the feelin Goes away desperado Why dont you come to your senses Come down from your fences Open the gates it may be rainin But theres a rainbow above you Youd better let somebody love you Let somebody love you Youd better let somebody love you Before its too late
