                Theres a girl Who sits under the bleachers Just another day eating alone And though she smiles There is something just hiding And she cant find a way to relate She just goes unnoticed As the crowd passes by And shell pretend to be busy When inside she just wants to cry And shell say Take a little look at the life of Miss always invisible look a little harder I really really want you to Put yourself in her shoes Take another look at the face of Miss always invisible Look a little closer and Maybe then you will see Why she waits for the day When youll ask her her name The beginning in the first weeks of class She did everything to try and fit in But the others they couldnt seem to Get past all the things that Mismatched on the surface And she would close her eyes When they left and she fell down the stairs And the more that they joked And the more that they screamed She retreated to where she is now And shell sing Take a little look at the life of Miss always invisible look a little harder I really really want you to Put yourself in her shoes yeah Take another look at the face of Miss always invisible Look a little closer and Maybe then you will see Why she waits for the day When youll ask her her name  Then one day just the same as the last just The days been in counting the time Came a boy who sat under the bleachers Just a little bit further behind
