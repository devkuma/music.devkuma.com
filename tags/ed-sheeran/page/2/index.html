                Came in for the embers Stayed out for the breeze I need to feel elements to remind me Theres beauty when its bleak Stuck out long before lights down Why do I breathe oh I know The more that I love the less that I feel The times that I jumped Never were real They say that all scars Will heal but I know maybe I wont But the waves wont break my boat But the waves wont break my boat The stones crash on the boardwalk The wind rush through the trees I keep my eyes peeled The memories always fall short Of what we couldve been Left out long before last call What do I need oh I know The more that I love the less that I feel The times that I jumped Never were real They say that all scars Will heal but I know maybe I wont But the waves wont break my boat But the waves wont break my boat But the waves wont break my boat Waves wont break my boat The more that I love the less that I feel The times that I jumped Never were real They say that all scars Will heal but I know maybe I wont And the waves wont break my boat
