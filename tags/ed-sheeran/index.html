                I took the supermarket flowers From the windowsill I threw the dayold tea From the cup Packed up the photo album Matthew had made Memories of a life thats been loved Took the get well soon Cards and stuffed animals Poured the old ginger beer Down the sink Dad always told me Dont you cry when youre down But mom theres a tear Every time that I blink Oh Im in pieces its tearing me up But I know A heart thats broke is a heart Thats been loved So Ill sing hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down Youd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go When God takes you back Hell say hallelujah youre home I fluffed the pillows Made the beds stacked the chairs up Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case John said hed drive Then put his hand on my cheek And wiped a tear From the side of my face And I hope that I see the world as you did Cause I know A life with love is a life Thats been lived So Ill sing hallelujah You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down Youd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go When God takes you back Hell say hallelujah youre home  Hallelujah you were an angel In the shape of my mum You got to see the person I have become Spread your wings and I know When God took you back He said hallelujah youre home

                When I was six years old I broke my leg I was running From my brother and his friends And tasted the sweet perfume Of the mountain grass I rolled down I was younger then take me back to when I found my heart and broke it here Made friends and lost them through the years And Ive not seen the roaring fields In so long I know Ive grown But I cant wait to go home Im on my way driving at 90 down Those country lanes singing to Tiny Dancer And I miss the way you make me feel And its real When we watched the sunset Over the castle on the hill Fifteen years old and smoking Handrolled cigarettes Running from the law through the backfields And getting drunk with my friends Had my first kiss on a Friday night I dont reckon that I did it right I was younger then take me back to when We found weekend jobs when we got paid Wed buy cheap spirits And drink them straight Me and my friends have not thrown up In so long oh how weve grown But I cant wait to go home Im on my way driving at 90 down Those country lanes singing to Tiny Dancer And I miss the way you make me feel And its real When we watched the sunset Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill  One friend left to sell clothes One works down by the coast One had two kids but lives alone Ones brother overdosed Ones already on his second wife Ones just barely getting by But these people raised me And I cant wait to go home And Im on my way I still remember These old country lanes When we did not know the answers And I miss the way you make me feel And its real When we watched the sunset Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill Over the castle on the hill

                I met this girl late last year She said Dont you worry if I disappear I told her Im not really Looking for another mistake I called an old friend Thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jump right in A week later returned I reckon she was only Looking for a lover to burn But I gave her my time For two or three nights Then I put it on pause Til the moment was right I went away for months Until our paths crossed again She told me I was never Looking for a friend maybe you could Swing by my room around 1000 Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin Well be in between the sheets Til the late AM baby if you wanted me Then you shouldve just said Shes singing Dont xuck with my love That heart is so cold all over my home I dont wanna know that babe Dont xuck with my love I told her she knows take aim and reload I dont wanna know that babe For a couple weeks I only wanna see her We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza Before a text message was The only way to reach her Now shes staying at my place And loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha All over the track like a feature And never wants to sleep I guess that I dont want to either But me and her we make money The same way four cities Two planes the same day And those shows have never been What its about but maybe well go Together and just figure it out Id rather put on a film With you and sit on the couch But we should get on a plane Or well be missing it now Wish Id have written it down The way that things played out When she was kissing him How I was confused about She should figure it out While Im sat here singing Dont xuck with my love That heart is so cold all over my home I dont wanna know that babe Dont xuck with my love I told her she knows take aim and reload I dont wanna know that babe On my hotel door I dont even know If she knows what for She was crying on my shoulder I already told ya Trust and respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next But you didnt need To take him to bed thats all And I never saw him as a threat Until you disappeared With him to have sex of course Its not like we were both on tour We were staying on the same Xucking hotel floor and I wasnt Looking for a promise or commitment But it was never just fun And I thought you were different This is not the way you realize What you wanted its a bit too much Too late if Im honest All this time God knows Im singing Dont xuck with my love That heart is so cold all over my home I dont wanna know that babe Dont xuck with my love I told her she knows take aim and reload I dont wanna know that babe Dont xuck with my love That heart is so cold all over my home I dont wanna know that babe Dont xuck with my love I told her she knows take aim and reload I dont wanna know that babe
