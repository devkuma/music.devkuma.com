                  I took the supermarket
flowers
From
the windowsill
I threw
the day-old tea
From
the cup
Packed up
the photo album
Matthew had
made
Memories of a life
that’s been loved
Took the get well
soon
Cards
and stuffed animals
Poured
the old ginger beer
Down
the sink
Dad always
told me
Don’t you cry
when you’re down
But mom
there’s a tear
Every time
that I blink
Oh I’m in pieces

visiting hours
So I could just
show up
And
bring the news
That
she’s getting older
And I wish
that you’d met her
The things that
she’ll learn from me
I got them all
from you
Can I just
stay a while
And we’ll put all
the world to rights
The little ones will
grow
And I’ll still drink
your favourite wine
And soon
they’re going to close

Burnt lungs

Light’s gone days end
struggling to pay rent
Long nights
strange men
And
they say
She’s in the class
A team
Stuck in her daydream
been this way since 18

her face seems
Slowly sinking
wasting
Crumbling

And
they scream
The worst things in
life come free to us
‘Cause we’re just

                  Walking down
29th and park
I saw you
in another’s arms
Only a month
we’ve been apart
You look
happier
Saw you walk
inside a bar
He said something
to make you laugh
I saw that both
your smiles were twice
As wide as ours
yeah
You look happier
you do
Ain’t nobody hurt you
like I hurt you
But ain’t nobody
love you like I do
Promise that
I will not take it

                  She played the fiddle
in an Irish band
But she fell in love
with an English man
Kissed her
on the neck
And then I took her
by the hand
Said baby
I just want to dance
I met her
on Grafton Street
Right outside
of the bar
She shared a cigarette
with me
While her brother
played the guitar
She asked me
what does it mean
The Gaelic ink

And build
a Lego house
If things go wrong
we can knock it down
My three words have
two meanings
But there’s one thing
on my mind
It’s
all for you
And it’s dark
in a cold December
But I’ve got you
to keep me warm
If you’re broken
I will mend ya
And keep you sheltered
from the storm
That’s raging on

I’m feeling

Every time that
I’m alone with you
We were sitting
in a parked car
Stealing kisses
in a front yard
We got questions
we should not ask but
How would you
feel
If I told you
I loved you
It’s just something
that I want to do
I’ll be taking my time
spending my life
Falling deeper in love

how can I help myself
Been inside
for most this year
And I thought
a few drinks
They might
help
It’s been a while
my dear
Dealin’ with the cards
life dealt
I’m still holdin’ back

I pictured this year
a little bit different
When it hit
February
I step in the bar
it hit me so hard

six years old
I broke my leg
I was running
From my brother
and his friends
And tasted
the sweet perfume
Of the mountain grass
I rolled down
I was younger then
take me back to when
I found my heart
and broke it here
Made friends and lost
them through the years
And I’ve not seen
the roaring fields
In so long
I know I’ve grown

from nights before
And my hair is thin
and falling out
Of all the wrong

I am a little
insecure
My eyes are crossed

I bite my nails

I go from thin

Dances
off your hair
A million colours

Golden

Saturday morning is

The sun’s
reflected
By the coffee
in your hand
My eyes are caught
in your gaze

We were love-drunk
waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves
in the winter snow
So alone
in love
Like the world had

late last year
She said “Don’t you
worry if I disappear”
I told her
I’m not really
Looking
for another mistake
I called
an old friend
Thinking that
the trouble would wait
But then
I jump right in
A week later returned
I reckon she was only
Looking
for a lover to burn
But I gave her
my time
For
two or three nights

I saw a shooting star
and thought of you
I sang
a lullaby
By the waterside
and knew
If you were here
I’d sing to you
You’re

As the skyline
splits in two

see the stars
From
America
