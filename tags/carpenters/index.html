                Ill say goodbye to love no one ever Cared if I should live or die Time and time again the chance for love Has passed me by and all I know of love Is how to live without it I just cant seem to find it So Ive made my mind up I must live my life alone And though its not the easy way I guess Ive always known Id say goodbye to love there are no Tomorrow for this heart of mine Surely time will lose these bitter Memories and Ill find that there is someone To believe in and to live for Something I could live for All the years of useless search Have finally reached an end Loneliness and empty days will be My only friend From this day love is Forgotten Ill go on as best I can  What lies in the future is a mystery To us all no one can predict The wheel of fortune as it falls There may come a time when I will see that Ive been wrong but for now This is my song and its goodbye to love Ill say goodbye to love
