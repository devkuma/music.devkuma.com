                Theres a calm surrender To the rush of day when the heat of The rolling world can be turned away An enchanted moment and it seems me Through its enough for This restless warrior just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight It is where we are its enough For this wide eyed wanderer That we got this far and can you feel The love tonight how its laid to rest Its enough to make kings And vagabonds believe the very best  Theres a time for everyone If they only learn that the twisting Kaleidoscope moves us all in turn Theres a rhyme and reason To the wild outdoors when the heart of This star crossed voyager Beats in time with yours And can you feel the love tonight It is where we are its enough For this wide eyed wanderer That we got this far and can you feel The love tonight how its laid to rest Its enough to make kings and vagabonds Believe the very best its enough to make Kings and vagabonds believe the very best

                I remember when rock was young Me and suzie had so much fun Holding hands and skimming stones Had an old gold chevy and a place Of my own but the biggest kick I ever got was doing a thing called The crocodile rock while the other kids Were rocking round the clock We were hopping and bopping to The crocodile rock well crocodile rocking Is something shocking when your feet Just cant keep still I never knew me A better time and I guess I never will Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights When suzie wore her dresses tight And the crocodile rocking was Out of sight la lalalalala Lalalalala lalalalala But the years went by and the rock just died Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy Long nights crying by the record machine Dreaming of my chevy and my old blue jeans But theyll never kill the thrills weve got Burning up to the crocodile Rock Learning fast as the weeks went past we really thought the crocodile rock Would last Well crocodile rocking Is something shocking when your feet Just cant keep still I never knew me A better time and I guess I never will Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights When suzie wore her dresses tight And the crocodile rocking was Out of sight la lalalalala Lalalalala lalalalala I remember when rock was young Me and suzie had so much fun Holding hands and skimming stones Had an old gold chevy and a place of my own But the biggest kick I ever got Was doing a thing called the crocodile Rock while the other kids were rocking Round the clock we were hopping and Bopping to the crocodile rock Well crocodile rocking is something shocking When your feet just cant keep still I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will oh lawdy mama Those Friday nights when suzie wore Her dresses tight and the crocodile Rocking was out of sight La lalalalala lalalalala Lalalalala la lalalalala Lalalalala lalalalala

                Goodbye Norma Jean Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled They crawled out of the woodwork And they whispered into your brain They set you on the treadmill And they made you change your name And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in and I would have liked To have known you but I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did  Loneliness was tough The toughest role you ever played Hollywood created a superstar And pain was the price you paid Even when you died Oh the press still hounded you All the papers had to say Was that Marilyn was found in the nude And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in and I would have liked To have known you but I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did  Goodbye Norma Jean Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled Goodbye Norma Jean from the young man In the 22nd row who sees you As something more than sexual More than just our Marilyn Monroe And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in and I would have liked To have known you but I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did your candle burned out Long before your legend ever did
