        &lt;p&gt;Now and then&lt;br&gt;
I think of&lt;br&gt;
When we were&lt;br&gt;
together&lt;br&gt;
Like when you said&lt;br&gt;
you felt so happy&lt;br&gt;
You could&lt;br&gt;
die&lt;br&gt;
I told myself that&lt;br&gt;
you were right for me&lt;br&gt;
But felt so lonely&lt;br&gt;
in your company&lt;br&gt;
But that was love and&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s an ache&lt;br&gt;
I still&lt;br&gt;
remember&lt;br&gt;
You can get&lt;br&gt;
addicted to a certain&lt;br&gt;
Kind of&lt;br&gt;
sadness&lt;br&gt;
Like resignation&lt;br&gt;
to the end&lt;br&gt;
Always&lt;br&gt;
the end&lt;br&gt;
So when we&lt;br&gt;
found that&lt;br&gt;
We could not&lt;br&gt;
make sense&lt;br&gt;
Well you said that we&lt;br&gt;
would still be friends&lt;br&gt;
But I&amp;rsquo;ll admit&lt;br&gt;
that I was glad&lt;br&gt;
That it was&lt;br&gt;
over&lt;br&gt;
But you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to&lt;br&gt;
cut me off&lt;br&gt;
Make out like it&lt;br&gt;
never happened&lt;br&gt;
And that&lt;br&gt;
we were nothing&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t even&lt;br&gt;
need your love&lt;br&gt;
But you treat me&lt;br&gt;
like a stranger&lt;br&gt;
And that&lt;br&gt;
feels so rough&lt;br&gt;
No you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to&lt;br&gt;
stoop so low&lt;br&gt;
Have your friends&lt;br&gt;
collect your&lt;br&gt;
Records and then&lt;br&gt;
change your number&lt;br&gt;
Guess that I don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
need that though&lt;br&gt;
Now you&amp;rsquo;re just&lt;br&gt;
somebody&lt;br&gt;
That I&lt;br&gt;
used to know&lt;br&gt;
Now you&amp;rsquo;re just&lt;br&gt;
somebody&lt;br&gt;
That I&lt;br&gt;
used to know&lt;br&gt;
Now you&amp;rsquo;re just&lt;br&gt;
somebody&lt;br&gt;
That I&lt;br&gt;
used to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now and then I think&lt;br&gt;
of all the times&lt;br&gt;
You screwed me&lt;br&gt;
over&lt;br&gt;
But had me&lt;br&gt;
believin&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
It was always&lt;br&gt;
something&lt;br&gt;
That I&amp;rsquo;d&lt;br&gt;
done&lt;br&gt;
But I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna&lt;br&gt;
live that way&lt;br&gt;
Reading into every&lt;br&gt;
word you say&lt;br&gt;
You said that you&lt;br&gt;
could let it go&lt;br&gt;
And I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
catch you hung up on&lt;br&gt;
Somebody that you&lt;br&gt;
used to know&lt;br&gt;
But you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to&lt;br&gt;
cut me off&lt;br&gt;
Make out like it&lt;br&gt;
never happened&lt;br&gt;
And that&lt;br&gt;
we were nothing&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t even&lt;br&gt;
need your love&lt;br&gt;
But you treat me&lt;br&gt;
like a stranger&lt;br&gt;
And that&lt;br&gt;
feels so rough&lt;br&gt;
No you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to&lt;br&gt;
stoop so low&lt;br&gt;
Have your friends&lt;br&gt;
collect your&lt;br&gt;
Records and then&lt;br&gt;
change your number&lt;br&gt;
Guess that I don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
need that though&lt;br&gt;
Now you&amp;rsquo;re just&lt;br&gt;
somebody&lt;br&gt;
That I&lt;br&gt;
used to know&lt;br&gt;
Somebody&lt;br&gt;
I used to know&lt;br&gt;
Somebody now you&amp;rsquo;re&lt;br&gt;
just somebody&lt;br&gt;
That I&lt;br&gt;
used to know&lt;br&gt;
Somebody&lt;br&gt;
I used to know&lt;br&gt;
Somebody now you&amp;rsquo;re&lt;br&gt;
just somebody&lt;br&gt;
That I&lt;br&gt;
used to know&lt;br&gt;
I used to know&lt;br&gt;
that I used to know&lt;br&gt;
I used to know&lt;br&gt;
somebody&lt;/p&gt;
