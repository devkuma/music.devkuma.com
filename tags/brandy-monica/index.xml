&lt;p&gt;You need to give it up&lt;br&gt;
had about enough&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that you&lt;br&gt;
seem to be confused&lt;br&gt;
He belongs to me&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
I think it&amp;rsquo;s time&lt;br&gt;
we got this straight&lt;br&gt;
Let&amp;rsquo;s sit and talk&lt;br&gt;
face to face&lt;br&gt;
There is no way&lt;br&gt;
you could mistake him&lt;br&gt;
For your man&lt;br&gt;
are you insane&lt;br&gt;
You see I know&lt;br&gt;
that you may be&lt;br&gt;
Just a bit&lt;br&gt;
jealous of me&lt;br&gt;
But you&amp;rsquo;re blind&lt;br&gt;
if you can&amp;rsquo;t see&lt;br&gt;
That his love is&lt;br&gt;
all in me&lt;br&gt;
You see I tried&lt;br&gt;
to hesitate&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna say&lt;br&gt;
what he told me&lt;br&gt;
He said without me&lt;br&gt;
he couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it&lt;br&gt;
Through the day&lt;br&gt;
ain&amp;rsquo;t that a shame&lt;br&gt;
Maybe you&lt;br&gt;
misunderstood&lt;br&gt;
Cause I can&amp;rsquo;t see&lt;br&gt;
how he could&lt;br&gt;
Wanna change something&lt;br&gt;
that&amp;rsquo;s so good&lt;br&gt;
Because my love is&lt;br&gt;
all it took&lt;br&gt;
You need to give it up&lt;br&gt;
had about enough&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that you&lt;br&gt;
seem to be confused&lt;br&gt;
He belongs to me&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
Must you do&lt;br&gt;
the things you do&lt;br&gt;
Keep on acting&lt;br&gt;
like a fool&lt;br&gt;
You need to know&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s me not you&lt;br&gt;
And if you didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
know it girl it&amp;rsquo;s true&lt;br&gt;
I think that&lt;br&gt;
you should realize&lt;br&gt;
And try to&lt;br&gt;
understand why&lt;br&gt;
He is a part&lt;br&gt;
of my life&lt;br&gt;
I know it&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
killing you inside&lt;br&gt;
You can say&lt;br&gt;
what you want to say&lt;br&gt;
What we have&lt;br&gt;
you can&amp;rsquo;t take&lt;br&gt;
From the truth&lt;br&gt;
you can&amp;rsquo;t escape&lt;br&gt;
I can tell the real&lt;br&gt;
from the fake&lt;br&gt;
When will you&lt;br&gt;
get the picture&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re the past&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m the future&lt;br&gt;
Get away it&amp;rsquo;s my time&lt;br&gt;
to shine&lt;br&gt;
And if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
You need to give it up&lt;br&gt;
had about enough&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that you&lt;br&gt;
seem to be confused&lt;br&gt;
He belongs to me&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
You can&amp;rsquo;t destroy&lt;br&gt;
this love I found&lt;br&gt;
Your silly games&lt;br&gt;
I won&amp;rsquo;t allow&lt;br&gt;
The boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
without a doubt&lt;br&gt;
You might as well&lt;br&gt;
throw in the towel&lt;br&gt;
What makes you think&lt;br&gt;
that he wants you&lt;br&gt;
When I&amp;rsquo;m the one&lt;br&gt;
that brought him to&lt;br&gt;
This special place&lt;br&gt;
in my heart&lt;br&gt;
Cause he was my love&lt;br&gt;
right from the start&lt;br&gt;
You need to give it up&lt;br&gt;
had about enough&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
You need to give it up&lt;br&gt;
had about enough&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that you&lt;br&gt;
seem to be confused&lt;br&gt;
He belongs to me&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
You need to give it up&lt;br&gt;
had about enough&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that you&lt;br&gt;
seem to be confused&lt;br&gt;
He belongs to me&lt;br&gt;
the boy is mine&lt;/p&gt;
