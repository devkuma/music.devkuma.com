                Its not simple to say Most days I dont recognize me That these shoes and this apron That place and its patrons Have taken more than I gave them Its not easy to know Im not anything like I used to be Although its true I was never Attentions sweet center I still remember that girl Shes imperfect but she tries She is good but she lies She is hard on herself She is broken and wont ask for help She is messy but shes kind She is lonely most of the time She is all of this mixed up And baked in a beautiful pie She is gone but she used to be mine Its not what I asked for Sometimes life just slips in Through a back door And carves out a person And makes you believe its all true And now Ive got you And youre not what I asked for If Im honest I know I would give it all back For a chance to start over And rewrite an ending or two For the girl that I knew Wholl be reckless just enough Wholl get hurt but who learns How to toughen up when shes bruised And gets used by a man who cant love And then shell get stuck And be scared of the life Thats inside her Growing stronger each day Til it finally reminds her To fight just a little To bring back the fire in her eyes Thats been gone But used to be mine used to be mine She is messy but shes kind She is lonely most of the time She is all of this mixed up And baked in a beautiful pie She is gone but she used to be mine
