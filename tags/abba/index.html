                The summer air was soft and warm The feeling right the Paris night Did its best to please us And strolling down the Elysee We had a drink in each cafe and you You talked of politics philosophy And I smiled like Mona Lisa We had our chance It was a fine and true romance I can still recall our last summer I still see it all Walks along the Seine laughing in the rain Our last summer memories that remain We made our way along the river And we sat down In the grass by the Eiffel Tower I was so happy we had met It was the age of no regret oh yes Those crazy years that was the time Of the flower power but underneath We had a fear of flying of getting old A fear of slowly dying we took the chance Like we were dancing our last dance I can still recall our last summer I still see it all In the tourist jam round the Notre Dame Our last summer walking hand in hand Paris restaurants our last summer Morning croissants Living for the day worries far away Our last summer we could Laugh and play  And now youre working in a bank The family man a football fan And your name is Harry how dull it seems Yet youre the hero of my dreams I can still recall our last summer I still see it all Walks along the Seine laughing in the rain Our last summer memories that remain I can still recall our last summer I still see it all In the tourist jam round the Notre Dame Our last summer walking hand in hand Paris restaurants our last summer Morning croissants Living for the day worries far away
