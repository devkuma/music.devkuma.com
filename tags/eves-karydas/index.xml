&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always thought when I sleep&lt;br&gt;
Was meant to be peaceful&lt;br&gt;
But my blood&amp;rsquo;s been running&lt;br&gt;
My teeth fall out in my dreams&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t know what it means now&lt;br&gt;
But it must mean something&lt;br&gt;
Wish I was in love wish I was alone&lt;br&gt;
Never wanna work wish I wasn&amp;rsquo;t broke&lt;br&gt;
Wish I had a clue had it figured it out&lt;br&gt;
But I really don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
So tell me&lt;br&gt;
When did everything&lt;br&gt;
here get so fucking complicated?&lt;br&gt;
Used to laugh at nothing&lt;br&gt;
don&amp;rsquo;t know how I got this jaded&lt;br&gt;
Thought it was fine&lt;br&gt;
Thought we had time&lt;br&gt;
But we feel dated&lt;br&gt;
When did everything&lt;br&gt;
here get so fucking complicated?&lt;br&gt;
Always thought when I&amp;rsquo;m older&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll be done waiting for my life to happen&lt;br&gt;
My grandfather was a soldier&lt;br&gt;
But all that I know is&lt;br&gt;
that I don&amp;rsquo;t know nothin&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
(No I don&amp;rsquo;t know nothin&amp;rsquo;)&lt;br&gt;
Wanted thicker skin wanted tougher bones&lt;br&gt;
Wanna be away wish I was at home&lt;br&gt;
Wish I had a clue had it figured out&lt;br&gt;
But I really don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
Again? Yeah&lt;br&gt;
Wish I was in love wish I was alone&lt;br&gt;
Never wanna work wish I wasn&amp;rsquo;t broke&lt;br&gt;
Wish I had a clue had it figured it out&lt;br&gt;
But I really don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
So tell me&lt;br&gt;
When did everything&lt;br&gt;
here get so fucking complicated?&lt;br&gt;
Used to laugh at nothing&lt;br&gt;
don&amp;rsquo;t know how I got this jaded&lt;br&gt;
Thought it was fine&lt;br&gt;

I never asked for this not once&lt;br&gt;
Bring me back to the basics&lt;br&gt;
(Back to the basics)&lt;br&gt;
Speeding up and I&amp;rsquo;m barely holding on&lt;br&gt;
Bring me back to the basics to the start&lt;br&gt;
So tell me&lt;br&gt;

Used to laugh at nothing&lt;br&gt;
