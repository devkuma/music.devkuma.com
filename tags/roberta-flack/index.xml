        &lt;p&gt;Strumming my pain&lt;br&gt;
with his fingers&lt;br&gt;
Singing my life&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Telling my whole life&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Woo&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
woo&amp;mdash;- woo&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;
I heard&lt;br&gt;
he sang a good song&lt;br&gt;
I heard&lt;br&gt;
he had had style&lt;br&gt;
And so&lt;br&gt;
I came to see him&lt;br&gt;
The listen&lt;br&gt;
for a while&lt;br&gt;
And there he was&lt;br&gt;
this young boy&lt;br&gt;
A stranger&lt;br&gt;
to my eyes-&lt;br&gt;
Strumming my pain&lt;br&gt;
with his fingers&lt;br&gt;
Singing my life&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Telling my whole life&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
I felt all flushed&lt;br&gt;
with fever in there&lt;br&gt;
Is vital crowd&lt;br&gt;
I felt&lt;br&gt;
He found my letters&lt;br&gt;
and read each one&lt;br&gt;
Out loud afraid that&lt;br&gt;
he would finish&lt;br&gt;
But he just&lt;br&gt;
kept right on-&lt;br&gt;
Strumming my pain&lt;br&gt;
with his fingers&lt;br&gt;
Singing my life&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Telling my whole life&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
He sang as&lt;br&gt;
if he knew me&lt;br&gt;
In all my dark despair&lt;br&gt;
and then he looked&lt;br&gt;
Right through me&lt;br&gt;
as if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there&lt;br&gt;
And he just&lt;br&gt;
kept on singing&lt;br&gt;
Singing&lt;br&gt;
clear and strong-&lt;br&gt;
Strumming my pain&lt;br&gt;
with his fingers&lt;br&gt;
Singing my life&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Telling my whole&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Uh&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash; la&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;
uh&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash; la&amp;mdash; la&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;
Strumming my pain&lt;br&gt;
with his fingers&lt;br&gt;
Singing my life&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song&lt;br&gt;
Telling my whole life&lt;br&gt;
with his words&lt;br&gt;
Killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
he was strumming&lt;br&gt;
My pain&lt;br&gt;
yeah he was singing&lt;br&gt;
My life&lt;br&gt;
killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
With his song&lt;br&gt;
killing me softly&lt;br&gt;
With his song&lt;br&gt;
telling my whole life&lt;br&gt;
With his words&lt;br&gt;
killing me&lt;br&gt;
Softly&lt;br&gt;
with his song-&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Here&lt;br&gt;
close to our feelings&lt;br&gt;
We touch again&lt;br&gt;
we love again&lt;br&gt;
Remember&lt;br&gt;
when we thought&lt;br&gt;
Our hearts&lt;br&gt;
would never mend&lt;br&gt;
And we&amp;rsquo;re all the&lt;br&gt;
better for each other&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s more to love&lt;br&gt;
I know than&lt;br&gt;
Making love Here&lt;br&gt;
no more confusion&lt;br&gt;
We see our lives&lt;br&gt;
we live our lives&lt;br&gt;
Remember&lt;br&gt;
when we thought&lt;br&gt;
We never&lt;br&gt;
would survive&lt;br&gt;
But now neither&lt;br&gt;
one of us is breaking&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
more to love&lt;br&gt;
I know than&lt;br&gt;
making love&lt;br&gt;
Somethings&lt;br&gt;
never change&lt;br&gt;
Somethings&lt;br&gt;
sometimes do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m feeling strong&lt;br&gt;
Enough to let you in&lt;br&gt;
And now neither&lt;br&gt;
One of us is breaking&lt;br&gt;
Now we know&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s more to love&lt;br&gt;
than making love&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you&lt;br&gt;
and making love&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;ll remember you&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;ll&lt;br&gt;
remember you&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Roberta Flack - The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face</title>

        &lt;p&gt;The first time&lt;br&gt;
ever I saw your face&lt;br&gt;
I thought the sun rose&lt;br&gt;
in your eyes&lt;br&gt;
And the moon and stars&lt;br&gt;
were the gifts&lt;br&gt;
You gave to the dark&lt;br&gt;
and the empty skies&lt;br&gt;
And the first time&lt;br&gt;
ever I kissed&lt;br&gt;
Your mouth&lt;br&gt;
and felt the earth&lt;br&gt;
Move in my hand&lt;br&gt;
like trembling heart&lt;br&gt;
Of a captive bird&lt;br&gt;
that was there&lt;br&gt;
At my command&lt;br&gt;
and the first time&lt;br&gt;
Ever I lay with you&lt;br&gt;
I felt your heart beat&lt;br&gt;
Close to mine&lt;br&gt;
I thought our joy&lt;br&gt;
Would fill the earth&lt;br&gt;
and would last&lt;br&gt;
Till the end of time&lt;br&gt;
my love&lt;br&gt;
The first time&lt;br&gt;
ever I saw your face&lt;br&gt;
Your face your face&lt;br&gt;
your face-&lt;/p&gt;
