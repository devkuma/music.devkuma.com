        &lt;p&gt;Storms are coming, rain is pouring&lt;br&gt;
Clouds are rolling, hanging over me&lt;br&gt;
Feels like I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m a loser in a losing game&lt;br&gt;
Trampled over same old movie scene&lt;br&gt;
Why&amp;rsquo;s it always happenin&amp;rsquo; to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m patching up my heart again, every time it explodes&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t tell me that I&amp;rsquo;ve gone insane, I know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause every single day is like whoa&lt;br&gt;
Wondering if you&amp;rsquo;d ever come back to me&lt;br&gt;
So what, we did everything wrong&lt;br&gt;
You know that it was really love actually&lt;br&gt;
Can I get some sympathy whoa&lt;br&gt;
Cause losing you is making a mess of me&lt;br&gt;
So what if you ended up gone&lt;br&gt;
You know that it was really love actually&lt;br&gt;
Love actually&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m being hunted, running from it&lt;br&gt;
Love&amp;rsquo;s a bullet piercing into me&lt;br&gt;
But I&amp;rsquo;m never giving in&lt;br&gt;
Like a lover, I just take the pain&lt;br&gt;
You should be screaming, can you hear your name&lt;br&gt;
Is anybody listening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause every single day is like whoa&lt;br&gt;
Wondering if you&amp;rsquo;d ever come back to me&lt;br&gt;
So what, we did everything wrong&lt;br&gt;
You know that it was really love actually&lt;br&gt;
Can I get some sympathy whoa&lt;br&gt;
Cause losing you is making a mess of me&lt;br&gt;
So what if you ended up gone&lt;br&gt;
You know that it was really love actually&lt;br&gt;
Love actually&lt;br&gt;
Love&lt;br&gt;
Love actually&lt;br&gt;
Love&lt;br&gt;
Love actually&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m patching up my heart again, every time it explodes&lt;br&gt;
And even though you try to save me, all I know is this&lt;br&gt;
Oh, I got too much love to give&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause every single day is like whoa&lt;br&gt;
Wondering if you&amp;rsquo;d ever come back to me&lt;br&gt;
So what, we did everything wrong&lt;br&gt;
You know that it was really love actually&lt;br&gt;
(You know that it was love actually)&lt;br&gt;
Yeah, cause losing you is making a mess of me&lt;br&gt;
So what if you ended up gone&lt;br&gt;
You know that it was really love actually&lt;br&gt;
(You know that it was love actually)&lt;br&gt;
Yeah, love&lt;br&gt;
Love actually&lt;br&gt;
Love&lt;br&gt;
Love actually&lt;/p&gt;
