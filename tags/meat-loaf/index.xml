        &lt;p&gt;And I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d run right into&lt;br&gt;
hell and back&lt;br&gt;
I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll never lie to you&lt;br&gt;
and that&amp;rsquo;s a fact&lt;br&gt;
But I&amp;rsquo;ll never&lt;br&gt;
forget the way you&lt;br&gt;
Feel right now&lt;br&gt;
oh no no way&lt;br&gt;
And I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
Oh I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
But I won&amp;rsquo;t do that no&lt;br&gt;
I won&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And somedays it&lt;br&gt;
don&amp;rsquo;t come easy&lt;br&gt;
And somedays it&lt;br&gt;
don&amp;rsquo;t come hard&lt;br&gt;
Somedays it&lt;br&gt;
don&amp;rsquo;t come at all&lt;br&gt;
And these are the days&lt;br&gt;
that never end&lt;br&gt;
And some nights&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;re breathing fire&lt;br&gt;
And some nights&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;re carved in ice&lt;br&gt;
Some nights&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;re like nothing&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen before&lt;br&gt;
or will again&lt;br&gt;
And maybe I&amp;rsquo;m crazy&lt;br&gt;
oh it&amp;rsquo;s crazy&lt;br&gt;
And it&amp;rsquo;s true&lt;br&gt;
I know you&lt;br&gt;
Can save me&lt;br&gt;
no one else&lt;br&gt;
Can save me&lt;br&gt;
now but you&lt;br&gt;
As long as the planets&lt;br&gt;
are turning&lt;br&gt;
As long as the stars&lt;br&gt;
are burning&lt;br&gt;
As long as your dreams&lt;br&gt;
are coming true&lt;br&gt;
You better&lt;br&gt;
believe it&lt;br&gt;
That I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
Oh I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
Oh I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
But I won&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;br&gt;
no I won&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;br&gt;
I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
Anything you&amp;rsquo;ve been&lt;br&gt;
dreaming of&lt;br&gt;
But I just&lt;br&gt;
won&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;br&gt;
I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
Anything you&amp;rsquo;ve been&lt;br&gt;
dreaming of&lt;br&gt;
But I just&lt;br&gt;
won&amp;rsquo;t do&lt;br&gt;
And somedays&lt;br&gt;
I pray for silence&lt;br&gt;
And somedays&lt;br&gt;
I pray for soul&lt;br&gt;
Somedays I just pray&lt;br&gt;
to the God of sex&lt;br&gt;
And drums and&lt;br&gt;
rock &amp;lsquo;N roll&lt;br&gt;
And maybe&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m lonely&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s all&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m qualified to be&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s just one&lt;br&gt;
and only one&lt;br&gt;
And only promise&lt;br&gt;
I can keep&lt;br&gt;
As long as the wheels&lt;br&gt;
are turning&lt;br&gt;
As long as the fires&lt;br&gt;
burning&lt;br&gt;
As long as&lt;br&gt;
your prayers&lt;br&gt;
Are coming true&lt;br&gt;
you better believe it&lt;br&gt;
That I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
And you know it&amp;rsquo;s true&lt;br&gt;
and that&amp;rsquo;s a fact&lt;br&gt;
I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
And there&amp;rsquo;ll never be&lt;br&gt;
no turning back&lt;br&gt;
But I&amp;rsquo;ll never do it&lt;br&gt;
better then I do it&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
so long so long&lt;br&gt;
And I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
Oh I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
I would do&lt;br&gt;
anything for love&lt;br&gt;
But I won&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;br&gt;
no I won&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;br&gt;
Will you raise me up&lt;br&gt;
will you help me down?&lt;br&gt;
Will you get me&lt;br&gt;
right out of&lt;br&gt;
This Godforsaken&lt;br&gt;
town?&lt;br&gt;
Will you make it all&lt;br&gt;
a little less cold?&lt;br&gt;
I can do that&lt;br&gt;
oh now I can do that&lt;br&gt;
Will you cater to&lt;br&gt;
every fantasy I got?&lt;br&gt;
Will you hose me down&lt;br&gt;
with holy water&lt;br&gt;
If I get too hot?&lt;br&gt;
will you take me&lt;br&gt;
Places&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve never known?&lt;br&gt;
Now I can do that&lt;br&gt;
oh now I can do that&lt;br&gt;
I know the territory&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been around&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;ll all&lt;br&gt;
turn to dust&lt;br&gt;
And we&amp;rsquo;ll&lt;br&gt;
all fall down&lt;br&gt;
And sooner&lt;br&gt;
or later&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;br&gt;
screwing around&lt;br&gt;
I won&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;br&gt;
no I won&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;br&gt;
Anything for love&lt;br&gt;
but I won&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;/p&gt;
