                Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park I used to think I would meet somebody there Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop You used to work at to make a little money  Time Curious time Gave me no compasses Gave me no signs Were there clues I didnt see And isnt it just so pretty to think All along there was some Invisible string Tying you to me  Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA You ate at my favorite spot for dinner Bold was the waitress on our threeyear trip getting lunch down by the Lakes She said I looked like an American singer  Time Mystical time Cutting me open then healing me fine Were there clues I didnt see And isnt it just so pretty to think All along there was some Invisible string Tying you to me  A string that pulled me Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire Chains around my demons Wool to brave the seasons One single thread of gold tied me to you  Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart Now I send their babies presents Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven  Time Wondrous time Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies And its cool Baby with me And isnt it just so pretty to think All along there was some Invisible string Tying you to me

                You were in college Working part time waiting tables Left a small town never looked back I was a flight risk with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love If it never lasts I say can you believe it As were lying on the couch The moment I can see it Yes yes I can see it now Do you remember We were sitting there by the water You put your arm around me For the first time You made a rebel of a Careless mans careful daughter You are the best thing thats ever been mine Flash forward And were taking on the world together And theres a drawer of My things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out Why Im guarded You say well never Make my parents mistakes But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes yes this is was I thought about Do you remember We were sitting there by the water You put your arm around me For the first time You made a rebel of a Careless mans careful daughter You are the best thing thats ever been mine Do you remember All the city lights on the water You saw me start to believe For the first time You made a rebel of a Careless mans careful daughter You are the best thing Thats ever been mine oh And I remember that fight 230 am Yes everything was slipping Right out of my hands And I ran out crying and you followed me Out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye Cuz thats all Ive ever known Then you took me by surprise You said Ill never leave you alone You said I remember How we felt sitting by the water And every time I look at you Its like the first time I fell in love with a Careless mans careful daughter She is the best thing thats ever been mine Hold on make it last Hold on never turn back You made a rebel of a Careless mans careful daughter You are the best thing thats ever been mine Do you believe it Were gonna make it now And I can see it see it now

                Vintage tee brand new phone High heels on cobblestones When you are young They assume you know nothing Sequin smile black lipstick Sensual politics when you are young They assume you know nothing But I knew you dancin in your Levis Drunk under a street light I I knew you hand under my sweatshirt Baby kiss it better I And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someones bed you put me on And said I was your favorite A friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls lose the one When you are young They assume you know nothing But I knew you playing hideandseek And giving me your weekends I I knew you Your heartbeat on the high line Once in twenty lifetimes I And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someones bed you put me on And said I was your favorite  To kiss in cars and downtown bars Was all we needed You drew stars around my scars But now Im bleedin Cause I knew you Steppin on the last train Marked me like a bloodstain I I knew you Tried to change the ending Peter losing Wendy I I knew you leavin like a father Running like water I And when you are young They assume you know nothing But I knew youd linger Like a tattoo kiss I knew youd haunt all of my whatifs The smell of smoke Would hang around this long Cause I knew everything When I was young I knew Id curse you for the longest time Chasin shadows in the grocery line I knew youd miss me Once the thrill expired And youd be standin In my front porch light And I knew youd come back to me Youd come back to me And youd come back to me And youd come back And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someones bed you put me on And said I was your favorite
