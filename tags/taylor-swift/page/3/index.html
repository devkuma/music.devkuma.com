                I have this thing Where I get older but just never wiser Midnights become my afternoons When my depression works the graveyard Shift all of the people Ive ghosted stand there in the room I should not be left to my own devices They come with prices and vices I end up in crisis tale as old as time I wake up screaming from dreaming One day Ill watch as youre leaving Cause you got tired Of my scheming for the last time Its me hi Im the problem its me At teatime everybody agrees Ill stare directly at the sun But never in the mirror It must be exhausting Always rooting for the antihero Sometimes I feel like Everybody is a sexy baby And Im a monster on the hill Too big to hang out slowly lurching Toward your favorite city Pierced through the heart But never killed Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind Of congressman tale as old as time I wake up screaming from dreaming One day Ill watch as youre leaving And life will lose All its meaning for the last time Its me hi Im the problem its me At teatime everybody agrees Ill stare directly at the sun But never in the mirror It must be exhausting Always rooting for the antihero I have this dream my daughterinlaw Kills me for the money She thinks I left them in the will The family gathers round and reads it And then someone screams out Shes laughing up at us from hell Its me hi Im the problem its me Its me hi Im the problem its me Its me hi everybody agrees Everybody agrees Its me hi Im the problem its me At teatime everybody agrees Ill stare directly at the sun But never in the mirror It must be exhausting Always rooting for the antihero
