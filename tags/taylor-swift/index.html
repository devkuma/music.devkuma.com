                When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old You ask for the tab Or that moment again hes insisting that friends Look at each other like that When the words of a sister come back in whispers That prove she was not in fact what she seemed Not a twin from your dreams Shes a crook who was caught  That old familiar body ache The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul You know when its time to go  Twenty years at your job Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours Or trying to stay for the kids When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse  That old familiar body ache The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul You know when its time to go  Sometimes giving up is the strong thing Sometimes to run is the brave thing Sometimes walking out is the one thing That will find you the right thing Sometimes giving up is the strong thing Sometimes to run is the brave thing Sometimes walking out is the one thing That will find you the right thing  Fifteen years fifteen million tears Begging til my knees bled I gave it my all he gave me nothing at all Then wondered why I left Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones Praying to his greed Hes got my past frozen behind glass But Ive got me  That old familiar body ache The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul I know when its time to go  Sometimes giving up is the strong thing Sometimes to run is the brave thing Sometimes walking out is the one thing That will find you the right thing Sometimes giving up is the strong thing Sometimes to run is the brave thing Sometimes walking out is the one thing That will find you the right thing  That will find you the right thing And you know in your soul And you know in your soul When its time to go You know you know you know you know When its time to go So then you go Then you go You just go
