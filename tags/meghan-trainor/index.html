                I found myself dreaming In silver and gold Like a scene from a movie That every broken heart knows We were walking on moonlight And you pulled me close Split second and you disappeared And then I was all alone I woke up in tears with you by my side A breath of relief and I realized No were not promised tomorrow So Im gonna love you Like Im gonna lose you Im gonna hold you Like Im saying goodbye Wherever were standing I wont take you for granted Cause well never know when When well run out of time So Im gonna love you Like Im gonna lose you Im gonna love you Like Im gonna lose you In the blink of an eye Just a whisper of smoke You could lose everything The truth is you never know So Ill kiss you longer baby Any chance that I get Ill make the most of the minutes And love with no regrets Lets take our time to say what we want Use what we got before its all gone Cause no were not promised tomorrow So Im gonna love you Like Im gonna lose you Im gonna hold you Like Im saying goodbye Wherever were standing I wont take you for granted Cause well never know when When well run out of time So Im gonna love you Like Im gonna lose you Im gonna love you Like Im gonna lose you Im gonna love you Like Im gonna lose you Im gonna hold you Like Im saying goodbye Wherever were standing I wont take you for granted Cause well never know when When well run out of time So Im gonna love you Like Im gonna lose you Im gonna love you Like Im gonna lose you
