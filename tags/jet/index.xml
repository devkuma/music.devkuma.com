        &lt;p&gt;Take my photo&lt;br&gt;
off the wall&lt;br&gt;
If it just won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
sing for you&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause all that&amp;rsquo;s left&lt;br&gt;
has gone away&lt;br&gt;
And there&amp;rsquo;s nothing&lt;br&gt;
there for you to prove&lt;br&gt;
Oh look&lt;br&gt;
what you&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve made&lt;br&gt;
a fool of everyone&lt;br&gt;
Oh well it seems&lt;br&gt;
likes such fun&lt;br&gt;
Until you lose&lt;br&gt;
what you had won hu&lt;br&gt;
Give me back&lt;br&gt;
my point of view&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause I just can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
think for you&lt;br&gt;
I can hardly hear&lt;br&gt;
you say&lt;br&gt;
What should I do&lt;br&gt;
well you choose&lt;br&gt;
Oh look&lt;br&gt;
what you&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve made&lt;br&gt;
a fool of everyone&lt;br&gt;
Oh well it seems&lt;br&gt;
likes such fun&lt;br&gt;
Until you lose&lt;br&gt;
what you had won&lt;br&gt;
Oh look&lt;br&gt;
what you&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve made&lt;br&gt;
