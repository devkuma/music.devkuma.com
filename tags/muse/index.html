                Its bugging me grating me And twisting me around Yeah Im endlessly caving in And turning inside out Cause I want it now I want it now Give me your heart and your soul And Im breaking out Im breaking out Last chance to lose control  Yeah its holding me morphing me And forcing me to strive To be endlessly cold within And dreaming Im alive Cause I want it now I want it now Give me your heart and your soul Im not breaking down Im breaking out Last chance to lose control  And I want you now I want you now I feel my heart implode And Im breaking out escaping now Feeling my faith erode
