&lt;p&gt;Well I&amp;rsquo;ve been&lt;br&gt;
waiting waiting&lt;br&gt;
Here so long&lt;br&gt;
But thinking nothing&lt;br&gt;
Nothing could go&lt;br&gt;
wrong But now I know&lt;br&gt;
She has a built&lt;br&gt;
in ability&lt;br&gt;
To take&lt;br&gt;
everything she sees&lt;br&gt;
And now it seems&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m falling&lt;br&gt;
Falling for her&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
Invisible&lt;br&gt;
touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
She reaches&lt;br&gt;
in grabs right&lt;br&gt;
Hold of your heart&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
Invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
It takes control and&lt;br&gt;
Slowly tears&lt;br&gt;
you apart&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t really know&lt;br&gt;
her I only know&lt;br&gt;
Her name&lt;br&gt;
But she crawls&lt;br&gt;
Under your skin&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re never&lt;br&gt;
Quite the same&lt;br&gt;
and now I know&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;s got something&lt;br&gt;
you just can trust&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s something&lt;br&gt;
mysterious&lt;br&gt;
And now it seems&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m falling&lt;br&gt;
Falling for her&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
Invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
She reaches&lt;br&gt;
In grabs right&lt;br&gt;
hold of your heart&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
It takes&lt;br&gt;
control and&lt;br&gt;
Slowly tears&lt;br&gt;
You apart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
She reaches&lt;br&gt;
in grabs right&lt;br&gt;
Hold of your heart&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
Invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
It takes control and&lt;br&gt;
Slowly tears&lt;br&gt;
you apart&lt;br&gt;
She don&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;br&gt;
losing to her&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s still a game&lt;br&gt;
Though she&amp;rsquo;ll&lt;br&gt;
Mess up your life&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll want her&lt;br&gt;
Just the same&lt;br&gt;
and now I know&lt;br&gt;
She has a&lt;br&gt;
built in ability&lt;br&gt;
To take&lt;br&gt;
everything she sees&lt;br&gt;
And now it&lt;br&gt;
seems I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen&lt;br&gt;
Fallen for her&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
Invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
She reaches in&lt;br&gt;
Grabs right&lt;br&gt;
hold of your heart&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
It takes control and&lt;br&gt;
slowly tears&lt;br&gt;
You apart&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
Invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
She reaches&lt;br&gt;

and slowly tears&lt;br&gt;
You apart&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
Invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
She reaches&lt;br&gt;
In grabs right&lt;br&gt;
hold of your heart&lt;br&gt;
She seems to have an&lt;br&gt;
invisible touch yeah&lt;br&gt;
She reaches&lt;br&gt;
in grabs right&lt;br&gt;
Hold of&lt;br&gt;
your heart&lt;/p&gt;
