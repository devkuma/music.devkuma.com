        &lt;p&gt;Remember when the streetlights came on&lt;br&gt;
And we had to be home?&lt;br&gt;
Remember when Elm Street came on?&lt;br&gt;
Couldn&amp;rsquo;t watch it alone&lt;br&gt;
Remember every prank call we made&lt;br&gt;
And star sixty-nine?&lt;br&gt;
Remember trying to hit eighty-eight&lt;br&gt;
To go back in time?&lt;br&gt;
Remember when they played &amp;lsquo;Purple Rain&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
To our first slow dance?&lt;br&gt;
Remember when we thought that first base&lt;br&gt;
Was just holding hands?&lt;br&gt;
Those days come back in the dead of night&lt;br&gt;
Those days that felt like another life&lt;br&gt;
What would you be doin&amp;rsquo; back in those days?&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;d be turnin&amp;rsquo; up the stereo&lt;br&gt;
And play it everywhere we&amp;rsquo;d go&lt;br&gt;
And so did everyone we&amp;rsquo;d know in those days&lt;br&gt;
And everybody got to fall in love&lt;br&gt;
With every movie made for us&lt;br&gt;
And God I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get enough of those days&lt;br&gt;
Remember every poster we had&lt;br&gt;
Hanging on the wall?&lt;br&gt;
Remember every t-shirt we stole&lt;br&gt;
From the local mall?&lt;br&gt;
(&amp;lsquo;Ace of Spades&amp;rsquo; by Motörhead)&lt;br&gt;
Remember Guns n&amp;rsquo; Roses came out?&lt;br&gt;
We were standin&amp;rsquo; in line&lt;br&gt;
Remember front row at that show?&lt;br&gt;
Camped out all night&lt;br&gt;
(Got so high &amp;lsquo;Sweet Child O&amp;rsquo; Mine&amp;rsquo;)&lt;br&gt;
Those days come back in the dead of night&lt;br&gt;
Those days that felt like another life&lt;br&gt;
What would you be doin&amp;rsquo; back in those days?&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;d be turnin&amp;rsquo; up the stereo&lt;br&gt;
And play it everywhere we&amp;rsquo;d go&lt;br&gt;
And so did everyone we&amp;rsquo;d know in those days&lt;br&gt;
And everybody got to fall in love&lt;br&gt;
With every movie made for us&lt;br&gt;
And God I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get enough of those days&lt;br&gt;
The time we&amp;rsquo;d waste &amp;lsquo;cause life could wait&lt;br&gt;
What we&amp;rsquo;d give to relive just a single day&lt;br&gt;
The time we&amp;rsquo;d waste &amp;lsquo;cause life could wait&lt;br&gt;
What we&amp;rsquo;d give to relive just a single day&lt;br&gt;
Instead of turnin&amp;rsquo; the page&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;d be turnin&amp;rsquo; up the stereo&lt;br&gt;
And play it everywhere we&amp;rsquo;d go&lt;br&gt;
And so did everyone we&amp;rsquo;d know in those days&lt;br&gt;
And everybody got to fall in love&lt;br&gt;
With every movie made for us&lt;br&gt;
And God I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get enough of those days&lt;br&gt;
(Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh)&lt;br&gt;
Those days that felt like another life&lt;br&gt;
(Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh)&lt;br&gt;
Those days come back in the dead of night&lt;br&gt;
(Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh)&lt;br&gt;
Those days that felt like another life&lt;br&gt;
What would you be doin&amp;rsquo; back in those days?&lt;/p&gt;
