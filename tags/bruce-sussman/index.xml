        &lt;p&gt;Her name was Lola&lt;br&gt;
she was a show girl&lt;br&gt;
With yellow feathers&lt;br&gt;
in her hair&lt;br&gt;
And a dress cut&lt;br&gt;
down to there&lt;br&gt;
She would merengue&lt;br&gt;
and do the cha cha&lt;br&gt;
And while she tried&lt;br&gt;
to be a star&lt;br&gt;
Tony always&lt;br&gt;
tended bar&lt;br&gt;
Across the&lt;br&gt;
crowded floor&lt;br&gt;
They worked from&lt;br&gt;
8 til 4&lt;br&gt;
They were young and&lt;br&gt;
they had each other&lt;br&gt;
Who could&lt;br&gt;
ask for more&lt;br&gt;
At the copa&lt;br&gt;
Copacabana&lt;br&gt;
The hottest spot&lt;br&gt;
north of Havana&lt;br&gt;
At the copa&lt;br&gt;
Copacabana&lt;br&gt;
Music and passion were&lt;br&gt;
always in fashion&lt;br&gt;
At the copa&lt;br&gt;
they fell in love-&lt;br&gt;
His name was Rico&lt;br&gt;
he wore a diamond&lt;br&gt;
He was escorted&lt;br&gt;
to his chair&lt;br&gt;
He saw Lola&lt;br&gt;
dancing there&lt;br&gt;
And when she finished&lt;br&gt;
he called her over&lt;br&gt;
But Rico&lt;br&gt;
went a bit to far&lt;br&gt;
Tony sailed&lt;br&gt;
across the bar&lt;br&gt;
And then the&lt;br&gt;
punches flew&lt;br&gt;
And chairs were&lt;br&gt;
smashed in two&lt;br&gt;
There was blood and&lt;br&gt;
a single gun shot&lt;br&gt;
But just who&lt;br&gt;
shot who&lt;br&gt;
At the copa&lt;br&gt;
Copacabana&lt;br&gt;
The hottest spot&lt;br&gt;
north of Havana&lt;br&gt;
At the copa&lt;br&gt;
Copacabana&lt;br&gt;
Music and passion were&lt;br&gt;
always in fashion&lt;br&gt;
At the copa&lt;br&gt;
she lost her love-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her name is Lola&lt;br&gt;
she was a show girl&lt;br&gt;
But that was&lt;br&gt;
30 years ago&lt;br&gt;
When they used to&lt;br&gt;
have a show&lt;br&gt;
Now it&amp;rsquo;s a disco&lt;br&gt;
but not for Lola&lt;br&gt;
Still in the dress&lt;br&gt;
she used to wear&lt;br&gt;
Faded feathers&lt;br&gt;
in her hair&lt;br&gt;
She sits there&lt;br&gt;
so refined&lt;br&gt;
And drinks herself&lt;br&gt;
half blind&lt;br&gt;
She lost her youth&lt;br&gt;
and she lost her Tony&lt;br&gt;
Now she&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
lost her mind&lt;br&gt;
At the copa&lt;br&gt;
Copacobana&lt;br&gt;
The hottest spot&lt;br&gt;
north of Havana&lt;br&gt;
At the copa&lt;br&gt;
Copacabana&lt;br&gt;
Music and passion were&lt;br&gt;
always in fashion&lt;br&gt;
At the copa&lt;br&gt;
don&amp;rsquo;t fall in love-&lt;/p&gt;
