        &lt;p&gt;He was working&lt;br&gt;
at the record shop&lt;br&gt;
I would kiss him&lt;br&gt;
in the parking lot&lt;br&gt;
Tasting&lt;br&gt;
like cigarettes&lt;br&gt;
And soda pop&lt;br&gt;
17&lt;br&gt;
He would tell me&lt;br&gt;
I was beautiful&lt;br&gt;
Sneaking&lt;br&gt;
in the neighbour&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
Swimming&lt;br&gt;
pool&lt;br&gt;
Yeah he taught me&lt;br&gt;
how to break&lt;br&gt;
The rules&lt;br&gt;
17&lt;br&gt;
Hey those days are&lt;br&gt;
long gone&lt;br&gt;
And when I hear&lt;br&gt;
the song&lt;br&gt;
It takes me&lt;br&gt;
back&lt;br&gt;
We were on top&lt;br&gt;
of the world&lt;br&gt;
Back&lt;br&gt;
when I was your girl&lt;br&gt;
We were living&lt;br&gt;
so wild and free&lt;br&gt;
Acting stupid for fun&lt;br&gt;
all we needed was love&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s the way&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be 17&lt;br&gt;
Stealing beers out&lt;br&gt;
of the trailer park&lt;br&gt;
Flicking lighters&lt;br&gt;
just to fight the dark&lt;br&gt;
My favorite place was&lt;br&gt;
sitting&lt;br&gt;
In his car&lt;br&gt;
17&lt;br&gt;
We laid a blanket&lt;br&gt;
on the rooftop&lt;br&gt;
That time&lt;br&gt;
I knew&lt;br&gt;
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
make him stop&lt;br&gt;
The nights were cold&lt;br&gt;
but we kept &amp;rsquo;em&lt;br&gt;
Hot&lt;br&gt;
17&lt;br&gt;
Hey those days are&lt;br&gt;
long gone&lt;br&gt;
And when I hear&lt;br&gt;
the song&lt;br&gt;
It takes me&lt;br&gt;
back&lt;br&gt;
We were on top&lt;br&gt;
of the world&lt;br&gt;
Back&lt;br&gt;
when I was your girl&lt;br&gt;
We were living&lt;br&gt;
so wild and free&lt;br&gt;
Acting stupid for fun&lt;br&gt;
all we needed was love&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s the way&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be&lt;br&gt;
We were running&lt;br&gt;
red lights&lt;br&gt;
We were going&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Didn&amp;rsquo;t care&lt;br&gt;
about anything&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause it was&lt;br&gt;
you and me&lt;br&gt;
We were living&lt;br&gt;
our dream&lt;br&gt;
We were&lt;br&gt;
17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember&lt;br&gt;
what it felt like&lt;br&gt;
Just a small town&lt;br&gt;
kind of life&lt;br&gt;
If I could&lt;br&gt;
only just go&lt;br&gt;
Back in time&lt;br&gt;
17&lt;br&gt;
We were on top&lt;br&gt;
of the world&lt;br&gt;
Back&lt;br&gt;
when I was your girl&lt;br&gt;
We were living&lt;br&gt;
so wild and free&lt;br&gt;
Acting stupid for fun&lt;br&gt;
all we needed was love&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s the way&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be&lt;br&gt;
We were running&lt;br&gt;
red lights&lt;br&gt;
We were going&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Didn&amp;rsquo;t care&lt;br&gt;
about anything&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause it was&lt;br&gt;
you and me&lt;br&gt;
We were living&lt;br&gt;
like a dream&lt;br&gt;
We were&lt;br&gt;
17 17 17 17&lt;/p&gt;
