                Sometimes I get so weird I even freak myself out I laugh myself to sleep Its my lullaby sometimes I drive so fast just to feel The danger I want to scream It makes me feel alive Is it enough to love is it enough to breath Somebody rip my heart out And leave me here to bleed Is it enough to die somebody save my life Id rather be anything but ordinary please To walk between the lines Would make my life so boring I want to know that I have been To the extreme so know me off my feet Come on now give it to me Anything to make me feel alive Is it enough to love is it enough to breath Somebody rip my heart out And leave me here to bleed Is it enough to die somebody save my life Id rather be anything but ordinary please Id rather be anything but ordinary please Let down your defenses use no comon senses If you look will see that this world is A beautiful accident turbulent succulent Opulent permanent no way I wanna taste it I dont wanna wast it away Sometimes I get so weird I even freak myself out I laugh my self to sleep its my lullaby Is it enough is it enough Is it enough to breath Somebody rip my heart out And leave me here to bleed Is it enough to die somebody save my life Id rather be anything but ordinary please Is it enough is it enough to die Somebody save my life Id rather be anything But ordinary please Id rather be anything but ordinary please

                He was working at the record shop I would kiss him in the parking lot Tasting like cigarettes And soda pop 17 He would tell me I was beautiful Sneaking in the neighbours Swimming pool Yeah he taught me how to break The rules 17 Hey those days are long gone And when I hear the song It takes me back We were on top of the world Back when I was your girl We were living so wild and free Acting stupid for fun all we needed was love Thats the way its supposed to be 17 Stealing beers out of the trailer park Flicking lighters just to fight the dark My favorite place was sitting In his car 17 We laid a blanket on the rooftop That time I knew I wouldnt make him stop The nights were cold but we kept em Hot 17 Hey those days are long gone And when I hear the song It takes me back We were on top of the world Back when I was your girl We were living so wild and free Acting stupid for fun all we needed was love Thats the way its supposed to be We were running red lights We were going all night Didnt care about anything Cause it was you and me We were living our dream We were 17  I remember what it felt like Just a small town kind of life If I could only just go Back in time 17 We were on top of the world Back when I was your girl We were living so wild and free Acting stupid for fun all we needed was love Thats the way its supposed to be We were running red lights We were going all night Didnt care about anything Cause it was you and me We were living like a dream We were 17 17 17 17
