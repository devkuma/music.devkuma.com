                If this life is one act Why do we lay all these traps We put em right in our path When we just wanna be free I will not waste my days Making up all kinds of ways To worry bout all the things That will not happen to me So I just let go Of what I know I dont know And I know I only do this By living in the moment Living my life Easy and breezy with peace in my mind Peace in my heart peace in my soul Wherever Im going Im already home Living in the moment Im letting myself off the hook For things Ive done I let my past go past And now Im having more fun Im letting go of the thoughts That do not make me strong And I believe this way Can be the same for everyone And if I fall asleep I know youll be the one Wholl always remind me To live in the moment Living my life Easy and breezy with peace in my mind Peace in my heart peace in my soul Wherever Im going Im already home I cant walk through life Facing backwards I have tried I tried More than once to just make sure And I was denied The future Id been searching for I spun around and hurt no more By living in the moment Living my life Easy and breezy with peace in my mind Peace in my heart peace in my soul Wherever Im going Im already home Im living in the moment Im living my life Just taking it easy with peace in my mind Got peace in my heart got peace in my soul Wherever Im going Im already home Im living in the moment Im living my life Easy and breezy with peace in my mind Peace in my heart peace in my soul Wherever Im going Im already home Living in the moment
