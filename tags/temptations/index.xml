KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=8608&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;8608&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the third&lt;br&gt;
of September&lt;br&gt;
That day I&amp;rsquo;ll always&lt;br&gt;
remember yes I will&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause that was&lt;br&gt;
the day&lt;br&gt;
That my daddy died&lt;br&gt;
I never got&lt;br&gt;
A chance to see him&lt;br&gt;
never heard nothing&lt;br&gt;
But bad things&lt;br&gt;
about him&lt;br&gt;
Mama I&amp;rsquo;m depending&lt;br&gt;
on you&lt;br&gt;
To tell me&lt;br&gt;
the tuth&lt;br&gt;
Mama just hung&lt;br&gt;
her head and said&lt;br&gt;
Son Papa was&lt;br&gt;
a rolling stone&lt;br&gt;
Wherever&lt;br&gt;
he laid his hat&lt;br&gt;
Was his home&lt;br&gt;
(and when he died)&lt;br&gt;
All he left us&lt;br&gt;
was alone&lt;br&gt;
Papa was&lt;br&gt;
a rolling stone my son&lt;br&gt;
Wherever&lt;br&gt;
he laid his hat&lt;br&gt;
Was his home&lt;br&gt;
(and when he died)&lt;br&gt;
All he left us&lt;br&gt;
was alone-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey Mama is it true&lt;br&gt;
what they say&lt;br&gt;
That Papa never worked&lt;br&gt;
a day in his life&lt;br&gt;
And Mama some bad talk&lt;br&gt;
going around town&lt;br&gt;
Saying that Papa had&lt;br&gt;
three outside children&lt;br&gt;
And another wife&lt;br&gt;
and that ain&amp;rsquo;t right&lt;br&gt;
Hey talk about&lt;br&gt;
Papa doing some store&lt;br&gt;
Front preaching&lt;br&gt;
talked about&lt;br&gt;
Saving souls and&lt;br&gt;
all the time leaching&lt;br&gt;
Dealing in debt&lt;br&gt;
and stealing&lt;br&gt;
In the name&lt;br&gt;
of the Lord&lt;br&gt;
Mama just hung&lt;br&gt;
her head and said&lt;br&gt;
Papa was&lt;br&gt;
a rolling stone my son&lt;br&gt;
Wherever&lt;br&gt;
he laid his hat&lt;br&gt;
Was his home&lt;br&gt;
(and when he died)&lt;br&gt;
All he left us&lt;br&gt;
was alone&lt;br&gt;
Hey Papa was&lt;br&gt;
a rolling stone&lt;br&gt;
Wherever&lt;br&gt;
he laid his hat&lt;br&gt;
Was his home&lt;br&gt;
(and when he died)&lt;br&gt;
All he left us&lt;br&gt;
was alone-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey Mama I heard&lt;br&gt;
Papa called himself&lt;br&gt;
A jack of all trades&lt;br&gt;
tell me is that&lt;br&gt;
What sent Papa&lt;br&gt;
to an early grave&lt;br&gt;
Folks say Papa would&lt;br&gt;
beg borrow steal&lt;br&gt;
To pay his bills&lt;br&gt;
hey Mama folks say&lt;br&gt;
That Papa never was&lt;br&gt;
much on thinking&lt;br&gt;
Spent most of his time&lt;br&gt;
chasing women&lt;br&gt;
And drinking&lt;br&gt;
Mama I&amp;rsquo;m depending&lt;br&gt;
On you&lt;br&gt;
to tell me the truth&lt;br&gt;
Mama looked up&lt;br&gt;
with a tear&lt;br&gt;
In her eye and said&lt;br&gt;
Son Papa was&lt;br&gt;
A rolling stone&lt;br&gt;
(well well well well)&lt;br&gt;
Wherever&lt;br&gt;
he laid his hat&lt;br&gt;
Was his home&lt;br&gt;
(and when he died)&lt;br&gt;
All he left us&lt;br&gt;
was alone&lt;br&gt;
Papa was&lt;br&gt;
a rolling stone&lt;br&gt;
Wherever&lt;br&gt;
he laid his hat&lt;br&gt;
Was his home&lt;br&gt;
(and when he died)&lt;br&gt;
All he left us&lt;br&gt;
was alone&lt;br&gt;
I said hey Papa was&lt;br&gt;
a rolling stone&lt;br&gt;
Wherever&lt;br&gt;
he laid his hat&lt;br&gt;
Was his home&lt;br&gt;
(and when he died)&lt;br&gt;
All he left us&lt;br&gt;
was alone-&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Temptations - Just My Imagination</title>

&lt;p&gt;Each day&lt;br&gt;
through my window&lt;br&gt;
I watch her&lt;br&gt;
as she passes by&lt;br&gt;
I say to myself&lt;br&gt;
your such a lucky guy&lt;br&gt;
To have a girl&lt;br&gt;
like her&lt;br&gt;
Is truly a&lt;br&gt;
dream come true&lt;br&gt;
Out of all the fellas&lt;br&gt;
in the world&lt;br&gt;
She belongs to you&lt;br&gt;
but it was&lt;br&gt;
Just my imagination&lt;br&gt;
running away with me&lt;br&gt;
It was&lt;br&gt;
just my imagination&lt;br&gt;
Running away&lt;br&gt;
with me woo-&lt;br&gt;
Soon we&amp;rsquo;ll be married&lt;br&gt;
and raise a family&lt;br&gt;
A cozy little home&lt;br&gt;
out in the country&lt;br&gt;
With two children&lt;br&gt;
maybe three&lt;br&gt;
I tell you I can&lt;br&gt;
visualize it all&lt;br&gt;
This couldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
be a dream&lt;br&gt;
For too real&lt;br&gt;
it all seems&lt;br&gt;
But it was&lt;br&gt;
just my imagination&lt;br&gt;
Once again&lt;br&gt;
running away with me&lt;br&gt;
Tell you it was&lt;br&gt;
just my imagination&lt;br&gt;
Running away&lt;br&gt;
with me-&lt;br&gt;
Every night&lt;br&gt;
on my knees I pray&lt;br&gt;
Dear lord&lt;br&gt;
hear my plea&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t ever&lt;br&gt;
let another&lt;br&gt;
Take her love from me&lt;br&gt;
or I will surely die&lt;br&gt;
(Her love is) heavenly&lt;br&gt;
when her arms&lt;br&gt;
Enfold me&lt;br&gt;
I hear a tender&lt;br&gt;
Rhapsody&lt;br&gt;
but in reality&lt;br&gt;
She doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
even know me&lt;br&gt;
(Just my imagination)&lt;br&gt;
once again&lt;br&gt;
Running away&lt;br&gt;
with me oh&lt;br&gt;
Tell you it was&lt;br&gt;
just my imagination&lt;br&gt;
Running away&lt;br&gt;
with me&lt;br&gt;
I never met her but&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t forget her&lt;br&gt;
Just my imagination&lt;br&gt;
oh yeah-&lt;br&gt;
Running away with me&lt;br&gt;
woo&lt;br&gt;
Just my imagination&lt;br&gt;
running away-&lt;/p&gt;
