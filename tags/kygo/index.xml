        &lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;rsquo;ve given up&lt;br&gt;
a hundred times before&lt;br&gt;
But I know&lt;br&gt;
a miracle&lt;br&gt;
Is not something&lt;br&gt;
to ignore&lt;br&gt;
You take me for a fool&lt;br&gt;
you take me for a fool&lt;br&gt;
I never knew anybody&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rsquo;til I knew you woo&lt;br&gt;
I never knew anybody&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rsquo;til I knew you woo&lt;br&gt;
And I know when&lt;br&gt;
it rains oh it pours&lt;br&gt;
And I know&lt;br&gt;
I was born to be yours&lt;br&gt;
I never knew anybody&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rsquo;til I knew you woo&lt;br&gt;
I never knew anybody&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rsquo;til I knew you woo&lt;br&gt;
And I know when&lt;br&gt;
it rains oh it pours&lt;br&gt;
And I know&lt;br&gt;
I was born to be yours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you the only one&lt;br&gt;
lost in the millions&lt;br&gt;
Or are you my grain&lt;br&gt;
of sand&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s blowing&lt;br&gt;
in the wind&lt;br&gt;
I never knew anybody&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rsquo;til I knew you woo&lt;br&gt;
I never knew anybody&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rsquo;til I knew you woo&lt;br&gt;
And I know when&lt;br&gt;
it rains oh it pours&lt;br&gt;
And I know&lt;br&gt;
I was born to be yours&lt;br&gt;
I never knew anybody&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rsquo;til I knew you woo&lt;br&gt;
I never knew anybody&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rsquo;til I knew you woo&lt;br&gt;
And I know when&lt;br&gt;
it rains oh it pours&lt;br&gt;
And I know&lt;br&gt;
I was born to be yours&lt;br&gt;
(I was born&lt;br&gt;
to be yours&lt;br&gt;
I was born&lt;br&gt;
born born born&lt;br&gt;
I was born to be yours&lt;br&gt;
I was born born born&lt;br&gt;
I was born&lt;br&gt;
to be yours&lt;br&gt;
I was born&lt;br&gt;
born born born&lt;br&gt;
I was born&lt;br&gt;
to be yours)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born&lt;br&gt;
to be yours&lt;br&gt;
I was born&lt;br&gt;
born born born&lt;br&gt;
I was born to be yours&lt;br&gt;
I was born born born&lt;br&gt;
I was born&lt;br&gt;
to be yours&lt;br&gt;
I was born&lt;br&gt;
born born born&lt;br&gt;
I was born to be yours&lt;br&gt;
I was born&lt;/p&gt;
