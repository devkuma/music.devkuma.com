        &lt;p&gt;Desert loving in your&lt;br&gt;
eyes all the way-&lt;br&gt;
If I- listen to your&lt;br&gt;
lies would you say&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m a man&lt;br&gt;
without conviction&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m a man-&lt;br&gt;
who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;br&gt;
How to sell-&lt;br&gt;
a contradiction&lt;br&gt;

Were like my dream&lt;br&gt;
red gold and green&lt;br&gt;
Red gold and green&lt;br&gt;
didn&amp;rsquo;t hear your&lt;br&gt;
Wicked words every day&lt;br&gt;
and you used to&lt;br&gt;
Be so sweet&lt;br&gt;
I heard you say&lt;br&gt;
That my love&lt;br&gt;
was and addiction&lt;br&gt;
When we cling-&lt;br&gt;
our love is strong&lt;br&gt;
When you go-&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;re gone forever&lt;br&gt;
You string along&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Give me time&lt;br&gt;
to realise my crime&lt;br&gt;
Let me love and steal&lt;br&gt;
I have danced&lt;br&gt;
Inside your eyes&lt;br&gt;
how can I be real&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to hurt me&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to make me cry&lt;br&gt;
Precious kisses words&lt;br&gt;
that burn me&lt;br&gt;
Lovers never&lt;br&gt;
ask you why&lt;br&gt;
In my heart&lt;br&gt;
the fire is burning&lt;br&gt;
Choose my colour&lt;br&gt;
find a star&lt;br&gt;
Precious people always&lt;br&gt;
tell me&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s a step a step&lt;br&gt;
too far&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to hurt me&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to make me cry&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to hurt me&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to make me cry-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words are few&lt;br&gt;
I have spoken&lt;br&gt;
I could waste&lt;br&gt;
a thousand years&lt;br&gt;
Wrapped in&lt;br&gt;
sorrow words are token&lt;br&gt;
Come inside&lt;br&gt;
and catch my tears&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve been talking&lt;br&gt;
but believe me&lt;br&gt;
If it&amp;rsquo;s true&lt;br&gt;
you do not know&lt;br&gt;
This boy loves&lt;br&gt;
without a reason&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m prepared&lt;br&gt;
to let you go&lt;br&gt;
If it&amp;rsquo;s love&lt;br&gt;
you want from me&lt;br&gt;
Then take it away&lt;br&gt;
everything&amp;rsquo;s not&lt;br&gt;
What you see&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s over again&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to hurt me&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to make me cry&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to hurt me&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to make me cry-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to hurt me&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to make me cry&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to hurt me&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to make me cry&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to hurt me&lt;br&gt;
Do you really&lt;br&gt;
want to make me cry-&lt;/p&gt;
