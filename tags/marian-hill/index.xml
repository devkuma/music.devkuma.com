        &lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t even&lt;br&gt;
really wanna go&lt;br&gt;
If you get me out&lt;br&gt;
you get a show&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s so many bodies&lt;br&gt;
on the floor&lt;br&gt;
So baby we should go&lt;br&gt;
and add some more&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
d-d-down d-d-down&lt;br&gt;
D-d-down&lt;br&gt;
down down&lt;br&gt;
Down&lt;br&gt;
d-d-down d-d-down&lt;br&gt;
D-d-down&lt;br&gt;
down down&lt;br&gt;
Everywhere I look are&lt;br&gt;
people&amp;rsquo;s hands&lt;br&gt;
Thrown up in the air&lt;br&gt;
to help &amp;rsquo;em dance&lt;br&gt;
Come on baby&lt;br&gt;
catch me if you can&lt;br&gt;
I know you don&amp;rsquo;t have&lt;br&gt;
any other plans&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
d-d-down d-d-down&lt;br&gt;
D-d-down&lt;br&gt;
down down&lt;br&gt;
Down&lt;br&gt;
d-d-down d-d-down&lt;br&gt;
D-d-down&lt;br&gt;
down down&lt;br&gt;
Are you down~&lt;br&gt;
are you down~&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you&lt;br&gt;
down~&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you down~&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
You know we could&lt;br&gt;
put &amp;rsquo;em all to shame&lt;br&gt;
Now isn&amp;rsquo;t the time&lt;br&gt;
to play it safe&lt;br&gt;
Isn&amp;rsquo;t this the reason&lt;br&gt;
why you came&lt;br&gt;
So baby don&amp;rsquo;t you&lt;br&gt;
let it go to waste&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
d-d-down d-d-down&lt;br&gt;
D-d-down&lt;br&gt;
down down&lt;br&gt;
Down&lt;br&gt;
d-d-down d-d-down&lt;br&gt;
D-d-down&lt;br&gt;
down down&lt;br&gt;
Every single thing is&lt;br&gt;
feeling right&lt;br&gt;
Started as a quiet&lt;br&gt;
Friday night&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t really&lt;br&gt;
think that&lt;br&gt;
We should&lt;br&gt;
fight this&lt;br&gt;
What if we don&amp;rsquo;t stop&lt;br&gt;
until it&amp;rsquo;s light&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
d-d-down d-d-down&lt;br&gt;
D-d-down&lt;br&gt;
down down&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
d-d-down d-d-down&lt;br&gt;
D-d-down&lt;br&gt;
down down&lt;br&gt;
Are you down~&lt;br&gt;
down~&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you&lt;br&gt;
down~&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you down~&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you are you&lt;br&gt;
are you down~&lt;br&gt;
Are you&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you down~&lt;br&gt;
down~&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you&lt;br&gt;
down~&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you down~&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you&lt;br&gt;
down~&lt;br&gt;
Are you down&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;br&gt;
Are you down~&lt;br&gt;
are you down&lt;/p&gt;
