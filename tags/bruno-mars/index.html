                Same bed but it feels Just a little bit bigger now Our song on the radio But it dont sound the same When our friends talk about you All it does is just tear me down Cause my heart breaks a little When I hear your name It all just sounds like woo hu Uhm too young too dumb to realize That I shouldve bought you flowers And held your hand Shouldve gave you all my hours When I had the chance Take you to every party Cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my babys dancin But shes dancin with another man My pride my ego My needs and my selfish ways Caused a good strong woman like You to walk out my life Now I never never get to Clean up the mess I made oh And it haunts me every time I close my eyes It all just sounds like woo hu Uhm too young too dumb to realize That I shouldve bought you flowers And held your hand Shouldve gave you all my hours When I had the chance Take you to every party Cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my babys dancin But shes dancin with another man Although it hurts Ill be the first To say that I was wrong Oh I know Im probably much too late To try and apologize for my mistakes But I just want you to know I hope he buys you flowers I hope he holds your hand Give you all his hours when he has the chance Take you to every party Cause I remember how much You loved to dance Do all the things I shouldve done When I was your man Do all the things I shouldve done When I was your man
