        &lt;p&gt;작곡: Sung by&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=8651&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;8651&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye to you&lt;br&gt;
my trusted friend&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ve known each other&lt;br&gt;
since we&amp;rsquo;re&lt;br&gt;
Nine or ten&lt;br&gt;
together we&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;br&gt;
Climbed hills or tree&lt;br&gt;
learned of love&lt;br&gt;
And ABC&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
skinned our hearts&lt;br&gt;
Skinned our knees&lt;br&gt;
goodbye my friend&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to die&lt;br&gt;
when all the birds&lt;br&gt;
Are singing in the sky&lt;br&gt;
now that&lt;br&gt;
The spring is&lt;br&gt;
in the air&lt;br&gt;
Pretty girls are&lt;br&gt;
everywhere&lt;br&gt;
When you see them&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll be there&lt;br&gt;
we had joy&lt;br&gt;
we had fun&lt;br&gt;
We had seasons&lt;br&gt;
in the sun&lt;br&gt;
But the hills&lt;br&gt;
that we climbed&lt;br&gt;
Were just seasons&lt;br&gt;
out of time&lt;br&gt;
Goodbye papa please&lt;br&gt;
pray for me&lt;br&gt;
I was the black sheep&lt;br&gt;
of the family&lt;br&gt;
You tried to teach me&lt;br&gt;
right from wrong&lt;br&gt;
Too much wine and&lt;br&gt;
too much song&lt;br&gt;
Wonder how I got along&lt;br&gt;
goodbye papa&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to die&lt;br&gt;
when all the birds&lt;br&gt;
Are singing&lt;br&gt;
in the sky&lt;br&gt;
Now that the spring&lt;br&gt;
is in the air&lt;br&gt;
Little children&lt;br&gt;
everywhere&lt;br&gt;
When you see them&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll be there&lt;br&gt;
We had joy&lt;br&gt;
we had fun&lt;br&gt;
We had seasons&lt;br&gt;
in the sun&lt;br&gt;
But the wine&lt;br&gt;
and the song&lt;br&gt;
Like the seasons&lt;br&gt;
have all gone&lt;br&gt;
We had joy&lt;br&gt;
we had fun&lt;br&gt;
We had seasons&lt;br&gt;
in the sun&lt;br&gt;
But the wine&lt;br&gt;
and the song&lt;br&gt;
Like the seasons&lt;br&gt;
have all gone&lt;br&gt;
Goodbye Michelle&lt;br&gt;
my little one&lt;br&gt;
You gave me love&lt;br&gt;
and helped me&lt;br&gt;
Find the sun&lt;br&gt;
and every time&lt;br&gt;
That I was down&lt;br&gt;
you would always&lt;br&gt;
Come around and get&lt;br&gt;
my feet back&lt;br&gt;
On the ground goodbye&lt;br&gt;
Michelle&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to die&lt;br&gt;
when all the birds&lt;br&gt;
Are singing&lt;br&gt;
in the sky&lt;br&gt;
Now that the spring&lt;br&gt;
is in the air&lt;br&gt;
With the flowers&lt;br&gt;
everywhere&lt;br&gt;
I wish that we could&lt;br&gt;
both be there&lt;br&gt;
We had joy&lt;br&gt;
we had fun&lt;br&gt;
We had seasons&lt;br&gt;
in the sun&lt;br&gt;
But the stars&lt;br&gt;
we could reach&lt;br&gt;
Were just starfishs&lt;br&gt;
on the beach&lt;br&gt;
We had joy&lt;br&gt;
we had fun&lt;br&gt;
We had seasons&lt;br&gt;
in the sun&lt;br&gt;
But the stars&lt;br&gt;
we could reach&lt;br&gt;
Were just starfishs&lt;br&gt;
on the beach&lt;br&gt;
We had joy&lt;br&gt;
we had fun&lt;br&gt;
We had seasons&lt;br&gt;
in the sun&lt;br&gt;
But the wine&lt;br&gt;
and the song&lt;br&gt;
Like the seasons&lt;br&gt;
have all gone&lt;br&gt;
All alight&lt;br&gt;
we had fun&lt;br&gt;
We had seasons&lt;br&gt;
in the sun&lt;br&gt;
But the hills&lt;br&gt;
that we climbed&lt;br&gt;
Were just seasons&lt;br&gt;
out of time&lt;br&gt;
We had joy&lt;br&gt;
we had fun&lt;br&gt;
We had seasons&lt;br&gt;
in the sun But the-&lt;/p&gt;
