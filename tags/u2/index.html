                Green light Seven Eleven You stop in for a pack of cigarettes You dont smoke dont even want to Hey now check your change Dressed up like a car crash Your wheels are turning But youre upside down You say when he hits you You dont mind Because when he hurts you You feel alive Hey babe is that what it is Red lights gray morning You stumble out of a hole in the ground A vampire or a victim It depends on whos around You used to stay In to watch the adverts You could lip synch to the talk shows And if you look you look through me And when you talk you talk at me And when I touch you You dont feel a thing If I could stay Then the night would give you up Stay and the day would keep its trust Stay and the night would be enough Faraway so close Up with the static and the radio With satellite television You can go anywhere Miami New Orleans London Belfast and Berlin And if you listen I cant call And if you jump you just might fall And if you shout Ill only hear you If I could stay Then the night would give you up Stay then the day would keep its trust Stay with the demons you drowned Stay with the spirit I found Stay and the night would be enough  Three oclock in the morning Its quiet and theres no one around Just the bang and the clatter As an angel runs to ground Just the bang and the clatter As an angel hits the ground
