&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pangaea we just fell apart&lt;br&gt;
Plate tectonics looking like my heart&lt;br&gt;
Whole world dropped&lt;br&gt;
Thought we were the same but we&amp;rsquo;re different&lt;br&gt;
Guess I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the distance&lt;br&gt;
Pangaea we just fell apart&lt;br&gt;
Yeah we were drifting away from the start&lt;br&gt;
Whole world dropped&lt;br&gt;
Thought we were the same but were different&lt;br&gt;
Guess I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the distance&lt;br&gt;
Pangaea always taking off when I need ya&lt;br&gt;
See ya I&amp;rsquo;m onto the next nice to meet you&lt;br&gt;
Thought we were the best I was wrong&lt;br&gt;
We were just a mess all along&lt;br&gt;
If I said I&amp;rsquo;m leaving&lt;br&gt;
Would you stay with me tonight?&lt;br&gt;
Cuz I&amp;rsquo;ve got a feeling&lt;br&gt;
That the ground might just divide&lt;br&gt;
Pangaea we just fell apart&lt;br&gt;
Plate tectonics looking like my heart&lt;br&gt;
Whole world dropped&lt;br&gt;
Thought we were the same but we&amp;rsquo;re different&lt;br&gt;
Guess I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the distance&lt;br&gt;
Pangaea we just fell apart&lt;br&gt;
Yeah we were drifting away from the start&lt;br&gt;
Whole world dropped&lt;br&gt;
Thought we were the same but were different&lt;br&gt;
Guess I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the distance&lt;br&gt;
Got me picking up the pieces of my heart no lie&lt;br&gt;
Got me reaching for the stars&lt;br&gt;
You set the bar so high&lt;br&gt;
Pangaea ripping out my heart now we distant&lt;br&gt;
Maybe you just love the attention&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t mention&lt;br&gt;
That every time you walked away&lt;br&gt;
I took you back no question&lt;br&gt;
Never had to worry &amp;lsquo;bout these girls&lt;br&gt;
Or my intentions&lt;br&gt;
I meant it I&amp;rsquo;m sad as fuck and rolling up alone&lt;br&gt;
Inside my car&lt;br&gt;
Pangaea we was doomed from the start&lt;br&gt;
Pangaea we just fell apart&lt;br&gt;
Plate tectonics looking like my heart&lt;br&gt;
Whole world dropped&lt;br&gt;
Thought we were the same but we&amp;rsquo;re different&lt;br&gt;
Guess I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the distance&lt;br&gt;
Pangaea we just fell apart&lt;br&gt;
Yeah we were drifting away from the start&lt;br&gt;
Whole world dropped&lt;br&gt;
Thought we were the same but were different&lt;br&gt;
Guess I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle the distance&lt;/p&gt;
