&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there no sign of light&lt;br&gt;
as we stand in the darkness?&lt;br&gt;
Watching the sun arise&lt;br&gt;
Is there no sign of life as we gaze at the waters?&lt;br&gt;
Into the strangers eyes&lt;br&gt;
And who are we to criticize&lt;br&gt;
Or scorn the things that they do?&lt;br&gt;
For we shall seek&lt;br&gt;
and we shall find Ammonia Avenue&lt;br&gt;
If we call for the proof&lt;br&gt;
and we question the answers&lt;br&gt;
Only the doubt will grow&lt;br&gt;
Are we blind to the truth&lt;br&gt;
Or a sign to believe in?&lt;br&gt;
Only the wise will know&lt;br&gt;
And word by word they handed down&lt;br&gt;
The light that shines today&lt;br&gt;
And those who came at first to scoff&lt;br&gt;
Remained behind to pray&lt;br&gt;
And word by word they handed down&lt;br&gt;
The light that shines today&lt;br&gt;
And those who came at first to scoff&lt;br&gt;
Remained behind to pray&lt;br&gt;
When you can&amp;rsquo;t hear the rhyme&lt;br&gt;
And you can&amp;rsquo;t see the reason&lt;br&gt;
Why should the hope remain?&lt;br&gt;
For a man will be tired&lt;br&gt;
And his soul will grow weary&lt;br&gt;
Living his life in vain&lt;br&gt;
Who are we&lt;br&gt;
To justify the right in all we do?&lt;br&gt;
Until we seek until we find Ammonia Avenue&lt;br&gt;
Through all the doubt somehow they knew&lt;br&gt;
And stone by stone they built it high&lt;br&gt;
Until the sun broke through&lt;br&gt;
A ray of hope, a shining light Ammonia Avenue&lt;br&gt;
Is there no sign of light&lt;br&gt;
as we stand in the darkness?&lt;br&gt;
Watching the sun arise&lt;br&gt;
Is there no sign of life as we gaze at the waters?&lt;br&gt;
Into the strangers eyes&lt;/p&gt;
