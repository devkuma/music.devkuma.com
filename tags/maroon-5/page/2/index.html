                It is so easy to see dysfunction Between you and me We must free up these tired souls Before the sadness kills us both I tried and tried to let you know I love you but Im letting go It may not last but I know I just dont know if you dont know Then you cant care And you show up but youre not there But Im waiting and you want to Still afraid that I will desert you Everyday with every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so Hard to stay nothing lasts forever But be honest babe It hurts but it may be the only way A bed that warm with memories Can heal us temporarily But misbehaving only makes the ditch Between us so damn deep I built a wall around my heart Ill never let it fall apart But strangely I wish secretly It would fall down while Im asleep If you dont know then you cant care And you show up but youre not there But Im waiting and you want to Still afraid that I will desert you Everyday with every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us make it so Hard to stay nothing lasts forever But be honest babe It hurts but it may be the only way Though we have not hit the ground It doesnt mean were not still falling Oh I want so bad to pick you up But youre still too Reluctant to accept my help What a shame I hope you Find somewhere to place the blame But until then the fact remains Everyday with every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes you so Hard to stay nothing lasts forever But be honest babe It hurts but it may be the only way Everyday with every worthless word We get more far away The distance between us makes it so Hard to stay but nothing lasts Forever but be honest babe It hurts but it may be the only way
