                Every dream that I dream Seems to float on by like a cloud In the wind way up in the sky Every move that I makes Seems to be the wrong way Like a cold black night After a summer day what can I do What can I do nothing to say But it used to be nothing to say But it used to be what can I do You still play my guitar With a smile on my face Now everythings changed My whole lifes rearranged From the day I was born Sidle jinks was my name Though I tried and I tried That name still remains What can I do what can I do Nothing to say but it used to be Nothing to say but it used to be What can I do  What can I do what can I do What can I do what can I do I hear voices all singing But no one is there its a ghost Of my life bringing past tense to mind Lockin key inside me from the freedom And sin oh come let me in Ill start all over again What can I do what can I do Nothing to say but it used to be No no no no no no no no no what can I do  What can I do what can I do what
