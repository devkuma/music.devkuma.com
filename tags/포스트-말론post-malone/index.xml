&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably think that you are&lt;br&gt;
Better now better now&lt;br&gt;
You only say that &amp;lsquo;cause&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not around not around&lt;br&gt;
You know I never meant to&lt;br&gt;
Let you down let you down&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you anything&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you everything&lt;br&gt;
You know I say that&lt;br&gt;
I am better now better now&lt;br&gt;
I only say that &amp;lsquo;cause&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re not around not around&lt;br&gt;
You know I never meant to&lt;br&gt;
Let you down let you down&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you anything&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you everything&lt;br&gt;
I did not believe that it would end no&lt;br&gt;
Everything came second to the benzo&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re not even speakin&amp;rsquo; to my friends no&lt;br&gt;
You knew all my uncles&lt;br&gt;
And my aunts though&lt;br&gt;
Twenty candles blow &amp;rsquo;em out&lt;br&gt;
And open your eyes&lt;br&gt;
We were lookin&amp;rsquo; forward&lt;br&gt;
To the rest of our lives&lt;br&gt;
Used to keep my picture posted&lt;br&gt;
By your bedside&lt;br&gt;
Now it&amp;rsquo;s in your dresser&lt;br&gt;
With the socks you don&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;m rollin&amp;rsquo; rollin&amp;rsquo; rollin&amp;rsquo; rollin&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
With my brothers like it&amp;rsquo;s jonas jonas&lt;br&gt;
Drinkin&amp;rsquo; henny and I&amp;rsquo;m tryna forget&lt;br&gt;
But I can&amp;rsquo;t get this shit outta my head&lt;br&gt;
You probably think that&lt;br&gt;
You are better now better now&lt;br&gt;
You only say that &amp;lsquo;cause&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not around not around&lt;br&gt;
You know I never meant&lt;br&gt;
To let you down let you down&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you anything&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you everything&lt;br&gt;
You know I say that&lt;br&gt;
I am better now better now&lt;br&gt;
I only say that &amp;lsquo;cause&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re not around not around&lt;br&gt;
You know I never meant to&lt;br&gt;
Let you down let you down&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you anything&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you everything&lt;br&gt;
I seen you with your other dude&lt;br&gt;
He seemed like he was pretty cool&lt;br&gt;
I was so broken over you&lt;br&gt;
Life it goes on what can you do?&lt;br&gt;
I just wonder what it&amp;rsquo;s gonna take&lt;br&gt;
Another foreign or a bigger chain&lt;br&gt;
Because no matter&lt;br&gt;
How my life has changed&lt;br&gt;
I keep on looking back on better days&lt;br&gt;
You probably think that&lt;br&gt;
You are better now better now&lt;br&gt;
You only say that&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause I&amp;rsquo;m not around not around&lt;br&gt;
You know I never meant to&lt;br&gt;
Let you down let you down&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you anything&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you everything&lt;br&gt;
You know I say that&lt;br&gt;
I am better now better now&lt;br&gt;
I only say that&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause you&amp;rsquo;re not around not around&lt;br&gt;
You know I never meant to&lt;br&gt;
Let you down let you down&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you anything&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you everything&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh&lt;br&gt;
I promise&lt;br&gt;
I swear to you I&amp;rsquo;ll be okay&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re only the love of my life&lt;br&gt;
You probably think that&lt;br&gt;
You are better now better now&lt;br&gt;
You only say that&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause I&amp;rsquo;m not around not around&lt;br&gt;
You know I never meant to&lt;br&gt;
Let you down let you down&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you anything&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you everything&lt;br&gt;
You know I say that&lt;br&gt;
I am better now better now&lt;br&gt;
I only say that&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause you&amp;rsquo;re not around not around&lt;br&gt;
You know I never meant to&lt;br&gt;
Let you down let you down&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you anything&lt;br&gt;
Woulda gave you everything&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh&lt;/p&gt;
