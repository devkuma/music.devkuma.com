&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No words appear before me in the aftermath&lt;br&gt;
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears&lt;br&gt;
Every single thing&lt;br&gt;
I touch becomes sick with sadness&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause it&amp;rsquo;s all over now all out to sea&lt;br&gt;
Goodbye goodbye goodbye&lt;br&gt;
You were bigger than the whole sky&lt;br&gt;
You were more than just a short time&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to pine about&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to live without&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m never gonna meet&lt;br&gt;
What could&amp;rsquo;ve been would&amp;rsquo;ve been&lt;br&gt;
What should&amp;rsquo;ve been you&lt;br&gt;
What could&amp;rsquo;ve been would&amp;rsquo;ve been you&lt;br&gt;
Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia?&lt;br&gt;
Did some force take you because I didn&amp;rsquo;t pray?&lt;br&gt;
Every single thing&lt;br&gt;
To come has turned into ashes&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause it&amp;rsquo;s all over it&amp;rsquo;s not meant to be&lt;br&gt;
So I&amp;rsquo;ll say words I don&amp;rsquo;t believe&lt;br&gt;
Goodbye goodbye goodbye&lt;br&gt;
You were bigger than the whole sky&lt;br&gt;
You were more than just a short time&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to pine about&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to live without&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m never gonna meet&lt;br&gt;
What could&amp;rsquo;ve been would&amp;rsquo;ve been&lt;br&gt;
What should&amp;rsquo;ve been you&lt;br&gt;
What could&amp;rsquo;ve been would&amp;rsquo;ve been you&lt;br&gt;
What could&amp;rsquo;ve been would&amp;rsquo;ve been&lt;br&gt;
What should&amp;rsquo;ve been you&lt;br&gt;
What could&amp;rsquo;ve been would&amp;rsquo;ve been you&lt;br&gt;
Goodbye goodbye goodbye&lt;br&gt;
You were bigger than the whole sky&lt;br&gt;
You were more than just a short time&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to pine about&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to live without&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m never gonna meet&lt;br&gt;
What could&amp;rsquo;ve been would&amp;rsquo;ve been&lt;br&gt;
What should&amp;rsquo;ve been you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were supposed to be just friends&lt;br&gt;
You don&amp;rsquo;t live in that part of town&lt;br&gt;
But maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll see you out some weekend&lt;br&gt;
Depending on what kind of mood&lt;br&gt;
And situationship I&amp;rsquo;m in&lt;br&gt;
And what&amp;rsquo;s in my system&lt;br&gt;
I think there&amp;rsquo;s been a glitch I&lt;br&gt;
Five seconds later I&amp;rsquo;m fastenin&amp;rsquo; myself to you&lt;br&gt;
With a stitch I&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;m not even sorry nights are so starry&lt;br&gt;
Blood moon lit&lt;br&gt;
It must be counterfeit&lt;br&gt;
I think there&amp;rsquo;s been a glitch uh&lt;br&gt;
Uh huh uh&lt;br&gt;
I was supposed to sweat you out&lt;br&gt;
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance&lt;br&gt;
On someone else&amp;rsquo;s playground&lt;br&gt;
But it&amp;rsquo;s been two thousand one hundred&lt;br&gt;
And ninety days of our love blackout&lt;br&gt;
(Our love is blacking out)&lt;br&gt;
The system&amp;rsquo;s breaking down&lt;br&gt;
(The system&amp;rsquo;s breaking down)&lt;br&gt;
I think there&amp;rsquo;s been a glitch I&lt;br&gt;
Five seconds later&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m fastenin&amp;rsquo; myself to you with a stitch I&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;m not even sorry nights are so starry&lt;br&gt;
Blood moon lit&lt;br&gt;
It must be counterfeit&lt;br&gt;
I think there&amp;rsquo;s been a glitch uh&lt;br&gt;
Uh huh uh&lt;br&gt;
A brief interruption a slight malfunction&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d go back to wanting due to givin&amp;rsquo; nothing&lt;br&gt;
I thought we had no chance&lt;br&gt;
And that&amp;rsquo;s romance let&amp;rsquo;s dance&lt;br&gt;
Glitch I&lt;br&gt;
Five seconds later I&amp;rsquo;m fastenin&amp;rsquo; myself to you&lt;br&gt;
With a stitch I&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;m not even sorry nights are so starry&lt;br&gt;
Blood moon lit&lt;br&gt;
It must be counterfeit(It must be counterfeit)&lt;br&gt;
I think there&amp;rsquo;s been a glitch uh&lt;br&gt;
Uh huh uh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lock broken slur spoken&lt;br&gt;
Wound open game token&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you were keeping count&lt;br&gt;
Rain soaking&lt;br&gt;
Blind hoping&lt;br&gt;
You said I was freeloading&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you were keeping Count&lt;br&gt;
High infidelity&lt;br&gt;
Put on your records and regret me&lt;br&gt;
I bent the truth too far tonight&lt;br&gt;
I was dancing around dancing around it&lt;br&gt;
High infidelity&lt;br&gt;
Put on your headphones and burn my city&lt;br&gt;
Your Picket fence is sharp as knives&lt;br&gt;
I was dancing around dancing around it&lt;br&gt;
Do you really want to know&lt;br&gt;
Where I was April 29th?&lt;br&gt;
Do I really have to chart the constellations&lt;br&gt;
In his eyes?&lt;br&gt;
Storm coming good husband&lt;br&gt;
Bad omen&lt;br&gt;
Dragged my feet right down the aisle&lt;br&gt;
At the house lonely&lt;br&gt;
Good money&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d pay if you&amp;rsquo;d just know me&lt;br&gt;
Seemed like the right thing at the time&lt;br&gt;
You know there&amp;rsquo;s many different ways&lt;br&gt;
That you can kill the one you love&lt;br&gt;
The slowest way is never loving them enough&lt;br&gt;
Do you really want to know&lt;br&gt;
Where I was April 29th?&lt;br&gt;
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me&lt;br&gt;
Back to life?&lt;br&gt;
High infidelity&lt;br&gt;
Put on your records and regret me&lt;br&gt;
I bent the truth too far tonight&lt;br&gt;
I was dancing around dancing around it&lt;br&gt;
High infidelity&lt;br&gt;
Put on your headphones and burn my city&lt;br&gt;
Your picket fence is sharp as knives&lt;br&gt;
I was dancing around dancing around it&lt;br&gt;
Do you really wanna know&lt;br&gt;
Where I was April 29th?&lt;br&gt;
Do I really have to chart the constellations&lt;br&gt;
In his eyes?&lt;br&gt;
You know there&amp;rsquo;s many different ways&lt;br&gt;
That you can kill the one you love&lt;br&gt;
The slowest way is never loving them enough&lt;br&gt;
High infidelity&lt;br&gt;

Ooh ooh ooh&lt;br&gt;
Woo woo woo&lt;br&gt;
Wooh&lt;br&gt;
Ooh ooh ohh&lt;br&gt;
Woo woo woo&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s many different ways&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re talking shit for the hell of it&lt;br&gt;
Addicted to betrayal but you&amp;rsquo;re relevant&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re terrified to look down&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause if you dare you&amp;rsquo;ll see the glare&lt;br&gt;
Of everyone you burned just to get there&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s coming back around&lt;br&gt;
And I keep my side of the street clean&lt;br&gt;
You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what I mean&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause karma is my boyfriend&lt;br&gt;
Karma is a god&lt;br&gt;
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend&lt;br&gt;
Karma&amp;rsquo;s a relaxing thought&lt;br&gt;
Aren&amp;rsquo;t you envious that for you it&amp;rsquo;s not?&lt;br&gt;
Sweet like honey karma is a cat&lt;br&gt;
Purring in my lap &amp;lsquo;cause it loves me&lt;br&gt;
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat&lt;br&gt;
Me and karma vibe like that&lt;br&gt;
Spider boy king of thieves&lt;br&gt;
Weave your little webs of opacity&lt;br&gt;
My pennies made your crown&lt;br&gt;
Trick me once trick me twice&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t you know that cash ain&amp;rsquo;t the only price?&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s coming back around&lt;br&gt;
And I keep my side of the street clean&lt;br&gt;
You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what I mean&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause karma is my boyfriend&lt;br&gt;
Karma is a god&lt;br&gt;

Sweet like honey karma is a cat&lt;br&gt;
Purring in my lap &amp;lsquo;cause it loves me&lt;br&gt;
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat&lt;br&gt;
Me and karma vibe like that&lt;br&gt;
Ask me what I learned from all those years&lt;br&gt;
Ask me what I earned from all those tears&lt;br&gt;
Ask me why so many fade but I&amp;rsquo;m still here&lt;br&gt;
(I&amp;rsquo;m still here I&amp;rsquo;m still here)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause karma is the thunder&lt;br&gt;
Rattling your ground&lt;br&gt;
Karma&amp;rsquo;s on your scent like a bounty hunter&lt;br&gt;
Karma&amp;rsquo;s gonna track you down&lt;br&gt;
Step by step from town to town&lt;br&gt;
Sweet like justice karma is a queen&lt;br&gt;
Karma takes all my friends to the summit&lt;br&gt;
Karma is the guy on the screen&lt;br&gt;
Coming straight home to me&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause karma is my boyfriend&lt;br&gt;
(Karma is my boyfriend)&lt;br&gt;
Karma is a god&lt;br&gt;
Karma is the breeze in my hair&lt;br&gt;
On the weekend(Weekend)&lt;br&gt;
Karma&amp;rsquo;s a relaxing thought&lt;br&gt;
Aren&amp;rsquo;t you envious that for you it&amp;rsquo;s not?&lt;br&gt;
Sweet like honey karma is a cat&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time the planets and the fates&lt;br&gt;
And all the stars aligned&lt;br&gt;
You and I ended up in the same room&lt;br&gt;
At the same time&lt;br&gt;
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse&lt;br&gt;
Of a chain reaction of countermoves&lt;br&gt;
To assess the equation of you&lt;br&gt;
Checkmate I couldn&amp;rsquo;t lose&lt;br&gt;
What if I told you none of it was accidental?&lt;br&gt;
And the first night that you saw me&lt;br&gt;
Nothing was gonna stop me&lt;br&gt;
I laid the groundwork and then&lt;br&gt;
Just like clockwork&lt;br&gt;
The dominoes cascaded in the line&lt;br&gt;
What if I told you I&amp;rsquo;m a mastermind?&lt;br&gt;
And now you&amp;rsquo;re mine&lt;br&gt;
It was all by design&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause I&amp;rsquo;m a mastermind&lt;br&gt;
You see all the wisest women&lt;br&gt;
Had to do it this way&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause we were born to be the pawn&lt;br&gt;
In every lover&amp;rsquo;s game&lt;br&gt;
If you fail to plan you plan to fail&lt;br&gt;
Strategy sets the scene for the tale&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m the wind in our free flowing sails&lt;br&gt;
And the liquor in our cocktails&lt;br&gt;
What if I told you none of it was accidental?&lt;br&gt;
And the first night that you saw me&lt;br&gt;
I knew that I wanted your body&lt;br&gt;
I laid the groundwork and then&lt;br&gt;
Just like clockwork&lt;br&gt;
The dominoes cascaded in a line&lt;br&gt;
What if I told you I&amp;rsquo;m a mastermind?&lt;br&gt;
And now you&amp;rsquo;re mine&lt;br&gt;
It was all my design&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause I&amp;rsquo;m a mastermind&lt;br&gt;
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid&lt;br&gt;
So I&amp;rsquo;ve been scheming like a criminal ever since&lt;br&gt;
To make them love me&lt;br&gt;
And make it seem effortless&lt;br&gt;
This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve felt the need to confess&lt;br&gt;
And I swear&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m only cryptic and Machiavellian&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause I care&lt;br&gt;
So I told you none of it was accidental&lt;br&gt;
And the first night that you saw me&lt;br&gt;
Nothing was gonna stop me&lt;br&gt;
I laid the groundwork and then&lt;br&gt;
Saw a wide smirk on your face&lt;br&gt;
You knew the entire time&lt;br&gt;
You knew that I&amp;rsquo;m a mastermind&lt;br&gt;
And now you&amp;rsquo;re mine&lt;br&gt;
Yeah all you did was smile&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause I&amp;rsquo;m a mastermind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain&lt;br&gt;
He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain&lt;br&gt;
He wanted a bride I was making my own name&lt;br&gt;
Chasing that fame he stayed the same&lt;br&gt;
All of me changed like midnight&lt;br&gt;
My town was a wasteland&lt;br&gt;
Full of cages full of fences&lt;br&gt;
Pageant queens and big pretenders&lt;br&gt;
But for some it was paradise&lt;br&gt;
My boy was a montage&lt;br&gt;
A slow motion love potion&lt;br&gt;
Jumping off things in the ocean&lt;br&gt;
I broke his heart &amp;lsquo;cause he was nice&lt;br&gt;
He was sunshine I was midnight rain&lt;br&gt;
He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain&lt;br&gt;
He wanted a bride I was making my own name&lt;br&gt;
Chasing that fame he stayed the same&lt;br&gt;
All of me changed like midnight&lt;br&gt;
It came like a postcard&lt;br&gt;
Picture perfect shiny family&lt;br&gt;
Holiday peppermint candy&lt;br&gt;
But for him it&amp;rsquo;s every day&lt;br&gt;
So I peered through a window&lt;br&gt;
A deep portal time travel&lt;br&gt;
All the love we unravel&lt;br&gt;
And the life I gave away&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause he was sunshine I was midnight rain&lt;br&gt;
He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain&lt;br&gt;
He wanted a bride I was making my own name&lt;br&gt;
Chasing that fame he stayed the same&lt;br&gt;
All of me changed like midnight rain&lt;br&gt;
He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain&lt;br&gt;
He wanted a bride I was making my own name&lt;br&gt;
Chasing that fame he stayed the same&lt;br&gt;
All of me changed like midnight&lt;br&gt;
I guess sometimes we all get&lt;br&gt;
Just what we wanted just what we wanted&lt;br&gt;
And he never thinks of me&lt;br&gt;
Except for when I&amp;rsquo;m on TV&lt;br&gt;
I guess sometimes we all get&lt;br&gt;
Some kind of haunted some kind of haunted&lt;br&gt;
And I never think of him&lt;br&gt;
Except on midnights like this&lt;br&gt;
(Midnights like this midnights like this)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Your ex friend&amp;rsquo;s sister&lt;br&gt;
Met someone at a club and he kissed her&lt;br&gt;
Turns out it was that guy&lt;br&gt;
You hooked up with ages ago&lt;br&gt;
Some wannabe Z lister&lt;br&gt;
And all the outfits were terrible&lt;br&gt;
2003 unbearable&lt;br&gt;
Did you see the photos?&lt;br&gt;
No I didn&amp;rsquo;t but thanks though&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m so in love that I might stop breathing&lt;br&gt;
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling&lt;br&gt;
No I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the news&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause we were somewhere else&lt;br&gt;
Stumbled down pretend alleyways cheap wine&lt;br&gt;
Make believe it&amp;rsquo;s champagne&lt;br&gt;
I was taken by the view&lt;br&gt;
Like we were in Paris&lt;br&gt;
Like we were somewhere else&lt;br&gt;
Like we were in Paris oh&lt;br&gt;
We were somewhere else&lt;br&gt;
Privacy sign on the door&lt;br&gt;
And on my page and on the whole world&lt;br&gt;
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours&lt;br&gt;
Levitated thought all the messes made&lt;br&gt;
Sip wine by my side in the shade&lt;br&gt;
And not the kind that&amp;rsquo;s thrown&lt;br&gt;
I mean the kind under where a tree has grown&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m so in love that I might stop breathing&lt;br&gt;
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling&lt;br&gt;
No I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the news&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause we were somewhere else&lt;br&gt;
Stumbled down pretend alleyways cheap wine&lt;br&gt;
Make believe it&amp;rsquo;s champagne&lt;br&gt;
I was taken by the view&lt;br&gt;
Like we were in Paris oh&lt;br&gt;
Like we were somewhere else&lt;br&gt;
Like we were in Paris oh&lt;br&gt;
We were somewhere else&lt;br&gt;
I wanna brainwash you&lt;br&gt;
Into loving me forever&lt;br&gt;
I wanna transport you&lt;br&gt;
To somewhere the culture&amp;rsquo;s clever&lt;br&gt;
Confess my truth&lt;br&gt;
In swooping sloping cursive letters&lt;br&gt;
Let the only flashing lights&lt;br&gt;
Be the tower at midnight&lt;br&gt;
In my mind&lt;br&gt;
We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling&lt;br&gt;
No I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the news&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause we were somewhere else&lt;br&gt;
In an alleyway drinking champagne&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause we were in Paris&lt;br&gt;
Yes we were somewhere else&lt;br&gt;
My love we were in Paris&lt;br&gt;
Yes we were somewhere else&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spy with my little tired eye&lt;br&gt;
Tiny as a firefly a pebble&lt;br&gt;
That we picked up last July&lt;br&gt;
Down deep inside your pocket&lt;br&gt;
We almost forgot it&lt;br&gt;
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?&lt;br&gt;
Ooh ooh&lt;br&gt;
They said the end is coming&lt;br&gt;
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s up to something&lt;br&gt;
I found myself a running home&lt;br&gt;
To your sweet nothings&lt;br&gt;
Outside they&amp;rsquo;re push and shoving&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re in the kitchen humming&lt;br&gt;
All that you ever wanted from me&lt;br&gt;
Was sweet nothing&lt;br&gt;
On the way home&lt;br&gt;
I wrote a poem&lt;br&gt;
You say &amp;lsquo;what a mind&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
This happens all the time&lt;br&gt;
Ooh ooh&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause they said the end is coming&lt;br&gt;
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s up to something&lt;br&gt;
I found myself a running home&lt;br&gt;
To your sweet nothings&lt;br&gt;
Outside they&amp;rsquo;re push and shoving&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re in the kitchen humming&lt;br&gt;
All that you ever wanted from me was nothing&lt;br&gt;
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors&lt;br&gt;
And smooth talking hucksters out&lt;br&gt;
Glad handing each other&lt;br&gt;
And the voices that implore&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;You should be doing more&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
To you I can&amp;rsquo;t admit that&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m just too soft for all of it&lt;br&gt;
Ooh&lt;br&gt;
They said the end is coming&lt;br&gt;
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s up to something&lt;br&gt;
I found myself a running home&lt;br&gt;
To your sweet nothings&lt;br&gt;
Outside they&amp;rsquo;re push and shoving&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re in the kitchen humming&lt;br&gt;
All that you ever wanted from me&lt;br&gt;
Was sweet nothing&lt;br&gt;
They said the end is coming&lt;br&gt;
(They said the end is coming)&lt;br&gt;
Everyone&amp;rsquo;s up to something&lt;br&gt;
(Everyone&amp;rsquo;s up to something)&lt;br&gt;
I found myself a running home&lt;br&gt;
To your sweet nothings&lt;br&gt;
Outside they&amp;rsquo;re push and shoving&lt;br&gt;
(Outside they&amp;rsquo;re push and shoving)&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re in the kitchen humming&lt;br&gt;
(You&amp;rsquo;re in the kitchen humming)&lt;br&gt;
All that you ever wanted from me&lt;br&gt;
Was sweet nothing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My knuckles were bruised like violets&lt;br&gt;
Suckerpunching walls&lt;br&gt;
Cursed you as I sleep talked&lt;br&gt;
Spineless in my tomb of silence&lt;br&gt;
Tore your banners down&lt;br&gt;
Took the battle underground&lt;br&gt;
And maybe it was ego swinging&lt;br&gt;
Baby it was her&lt;br&gt;
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur&lt;br&gt;
All that blood shed crimson and clover&lt;br&gt;
Uhum sweet dream was over&lt;br&gt;
My hand was the one you reached for&lt;br&gt;
All throughout the Great War&lt;br&gt;
Always remember&lt;br&gt;
Uhum tears on the letter&lt;br&gt;
I vow not to cry anymore&lt;br&gt;
If we survive thе Great War&lt;br&gt;
You drew up some good faith treaties&lt;br&gt;
I drew curtains closed drank my poison all alone&lt;br&gt;
You said I have to trust more freely&lt;br&gt;
But diesel is desire you were playing with fire&lt;br&gt;
And maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the past that&amp;rsquo;s talking&lt;br&gt;
Screaming from a crypt&lt;br&gt;
Telling me to punish you for things you never did&lt;br&gt;
So I justified it&lt;br&gt;
All that blood shed crimson and clover&lt;br&gt;
Uhum the bombs were close&lt;br&gt;
My hand was the one you reached for&lt;br&gt;
All throughout the Great War&lt;br&gt;
Always remember&lt;br&gt;
Uhum the burning embers&lt;br&gt;
I vow not to cry anymore&lt;br&gt;
If we survive the Great War&lt;br&gt;
Uhum uhum&lt;br&gt;
It turned into something bigger&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere in the haze got a sense&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been betrayed&lt;br&gt;
Your finger up my hair pent trigger&lt;br&gt;
Sold you down on that icy crown&lt;br&gt;
You looked up at me with honor and truth&lt;br&gt;
Broken and blue so I called off the truce&lt;br&gt;
That was the momemnt I knew I lost you&lt;br&gt;
I really thought I lost you&lt;br&gt;
We can&amp;rsquo;t plant a memory garden&lt;br&gt;
Say a solemn prayer place a poppy in my hair&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s no morning glory&lt;br&gt;
It was war it wasn&amp;rsquo;t fair&lt;br&gt;
And we will never go back&lt;br&gt;
To that blood shed crimson and clover&lt;br&gt;
Uhum the worst was over&lt;br&gt;
My hand was the one you reached for&lt;br&gt;
All throughout the Great War&lt;br&gt;
Always remember&lt;br&gt;
Uhum we burn for better&lt;br&gt;
I vow I will always be yours&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause we survived the Great War&lt;br&gt;
Uhum uhum&lt;br&gt;
I will always be yours&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause we survived the Great War&lt;br&gt;
Uhum&lt;br&gt;
I vow I will always be yours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man&lt;br&gt;
You did some bad things&lt;br&gt;
But I&amp;rsquo;m the worst of them&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes I wonder which one&amp;rsquo;ll be your last lie&lt;br&gt;
They say looks can kill and I might try&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t dress for women&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t dress for men&lt;br&gt;
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been dressin&amp;rsquo; for revenge&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t start shit but I can tell you how it ends&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t get sad get even&lt;br&gt;
So on the weekends&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t dress for friends&lt;br&gt;
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been dressin&amp;rsquo; for revenge&lt;br&gt;
She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some&lt;br&gt;
She had the envelope&lt;br&gt;
Where you think she got it from?&lt;br&gt;
Now she gets the house gets the kids&lt;br&gt;
Gets the pride&lt;br&gt;
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex wife&lt;br&gt;
And she looks so pretty&lt;br&gt;
Drivin&amp;rsquo; in your Benz&lt;br&gt;
Lately she&amp;rsquo;s been dressin&amp;rsquo; for revenge&lt;br&gt;
She don&amp;rsquo;t start shit&lt;br&gt;
But she can tell you how it ends&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t get sad get even&lt;br&gt;
So on the weekends&lt;br&gt;
She don&amp;rsquo;t dress for friends&lt;br&gt;
Lately she&amp;rsquo;s been dressing for revenge&lt;br&gt;
Ladies always rise above&lt;br&gt;
Ladies know what people want&lt;br&gt;
Someone sweet and kind and fun&lt;br&gt;
The lady simply had enough&lt;br&gt;
Well he was doin&amp;rsquo; lines and crossin&amp;rsquo; all of mine&lt;br&gt;
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI&lt;br&gt;
And I don&amp;rsquo;t dress for villains&lt;br&gt;
Or for innocents&lt;br&gt;
On my vigilante shit again&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t start shit but I can tell you how it ends&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t get sad get even&lt;br&gt;
So on the weekends&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t dress for friends&lt;br&gt;
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been dressin&amp;rsquo; for revenge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would&amp;rsquo;ve blinked&lt;br&gt;
Then I would&amp;rsquo;ve looked away at the first glance&lt;br&gt;
If you tasted poison you could&amp;rsquo;ve spit me out&lt;br&gt;
At the first chance&lt;br&gt;
And if I was some paint&lt;br&gt;
Did it splatter on a promising grown man?&lt;br&gt;
And if I was a child did it matter&lt;br&gt;
If you got to wash your hands?&lt;br&gt;
Ooh ooh ooh&lt;br&gt;
All I used to do was pray&lt;br&gt;
Would&amp;rsquo;ve could&amp;rsquo;ve should&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;br&gt;
If you never looked my way&lt;br&gt;
I would&amp;rsquo;ve stayed on my knees&lt;br&gt;
And I damn sure never would&amp;rsquo;ve danced&lt;br&gt;
With the devil&lt;br&gt;
At 19 and the God&amp;rsquo;s honest truth is that&lt;br&gt;
The pain was Heaven&lt;br&gt;
And now that I&amp;rsquo;m grown I&amp;rsquo;m scared of ghosts&lt;br&gt;
Memories feel like weapons&lt;br&gt;
And now that I know&lt;br&gt;
I wish you left me wondering&lt;br&gt;
If you never touched me&lt;br&gt;
I would&amp;rsquo;ve gone along with the righteous&lt;br&gt;
If I never blushed&lt;br&gt;
Then they could&amp;rsquo;ve never whispered about this&lt;br&gt;
And if you never saved me from boredom&lt;br&gt;
I could&amp;rsquo;ve gone on as I was&lt;br&gt;
But lord you made me feel important&lt;br&gt;
And then you tried to erase us&lt;br&gt;
Ooh ooh ooh&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re a crisis of my faith&lt;br&gt;
Would&amp;rsquo;ve could&amp;rsquo;ve should&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;br&gt;
If I only played it safe&lt;br&gt;
I would&amp;rsquo;ve stayed on my knees&lt;br&gt;
And I damn sure never would&amp;rsquo;ve danced&lt;br&gt;
With the devil&lt;br&gt;
At 19 and the God&amp;rsquo;s honest truth is that&lt;br&gt;
The pain was Heaven&lt;br&gt;
And now that I&amp;rsquo;m grown I&amp;rsquo;m scared of ghosts&lt;br&gt;
Memories feel like weapons&lt;br&gt;
And now that I know&lt;br&gt;
I wish you left me wondering&lt;br&gt;
God rest my soul&lt;br&gt;
I miss who I used to be&lt;br&gt;
The tomb won&amp;rsquo;t close&lt;br&gt;
Stained glass windows in my mind&lt;br&gt;
I regret you all the time&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t let this go I fight with you in my sleep&lt;br&gt;
The wound won&amp;rsquo;t close&lt;br&gt;
I keep on waiting for a sign&lt;br&gt;
I regret you all the time&lt;br&gt;
If clarity&amp;rsquo;s in death then why won&amp;rsquo;t this die?&lt;br&gt;
Years of tearing down our banners you and I&lt;br&gt;
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts&lt;br&gt;
Give me me back my girlhood it was mine first&lt;br&gt;
And I damn sure would&amp;rsquo;ve never danced&lt;br&gt;
With the devil&lt;br&gt;
At 19 and the God&amp;rsquo;s honest truth is that&lt;br&gt;
The pain was heaven&lt;br&gt;
And now that I&amp;rsquo;m grown I&amp;rsquo;m scared of ghosts&lt;br&gt;
Memories feel like weapons&lt;br&gt;
And now that I know&lt;br&gt;

I miss who I used to be&lt;br&gt;
The tomb won&amp;rsquo;t close&lt;br&gt;
Stained glass windows in my mind&lt;br&gt;
I regret you all the time&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t let this go I fight with you in my sleep&lt;br&gt;
The wound won&amp;rsquo;t close&lt;br&gt;
I keep on waiting for a sign&lt;br&gt;
I regret you all the time&lt;br&gt;
Oh God rest my soul&lt;br&gt;
I miss who I used to be&lt;br&gt;
The tomb won&amp;rsquo;t close&lt;br&gt;
Stained glass windows in my mind&lt;br&gt;
I regret you all the time&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t let this go I fight with you in my sleep&lt;br&gt;
The wound won&amp;rsquo;t close&lt;br&gt;
I keep on waiting for a sign&lt;br&gt;
I regret you all the time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear reader if it feels like a trap&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re already in one&lt;br&gt;
Dear reader get out your map&lt;br&gt;
Pick somewhere and just run&lt;br&gt;
Dear reader burn all the files&lt;br&gt;
Desert all your past lives&lt;br&gt;
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize yourself&lt;br&gt;
That means you did it right&lt;br&gt;
Never take advice from someone&lt;br&gt;
Who&amp;rsquo;s falling apart&lt;br&gt;
Never take advice from someone&lt;br&gt;
Who&amp;rsquo;s falling apart&lt;br&gt;
Dear reader bend when you can&lt;br&gt;
Snap when you have to&lt;br&gt;
Dear reader you don&amp;rsquo;t have to answer&lt;br&gt;
Just &amp;lsquo;cause they asked you&lt;br&gt;
(You should find another)&lt;br&gt;
Dear reader the greatest of luxuries is&lt;br&gt;
Your secrets&lt;br&gt;
Dear reader when you aim at the devil&lt;br&gt;
Make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t miss&lt;br&gt;
Never take advice from someone&lt;br&gt;
Who&amp;rsquo;s falling apart&lt;br&gt;
Never take advice from someone&lt;br&gt;
Who&amp;rsquo;s falling apart&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t want to prove these nights are&lt;br&gt;
For hiding in plain sight&lt;br&gt;
My fourth drink in my hand&lt;br&gt;
These desperate prayers are the cursed man&lt;br&gt;
Spilling out to you for free&lt;br&gt;
But darling darling please&lt;br&gt;
You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it&lt;br&gt;
If you knew who was talking&lt;br&gt;
If you knew where I was walking&lt;br&gt;
To a house not a home&lt;br&gt;
All alone &amp;lsquo;cause nobody&amp;rsquo;s there&lt;br&gt;
Where I pace in my pent&lt;br&gt;
And my friends found friends who care&lt;br&gt;
No one sees when you lose&lt;br&gt;
When you&amp;rsquo;re playing solitaire&lt;br&gt;
You should find another guiding light guiding light&lt;br&gt;
While I shine so bright&lt;br&gt;
You should find another guiding light guiding light&lt;br&gt;
While I shine so bright&lt;br&gt;
You should find another&lt;br&gt;
You should find another(Guiding light)&lt;br&gt;
Find another you should find another&lt;br&gt;
You should find another&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;It only hurts this much right now&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
Was what I was thinkin&amp;rsquo; the whole time&lt;br&gt;
Breathe in breathe through breathe deep&lt;br&gt;
Breathe out&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll be gettin&amp;rsquo; over you my whole life&lt;br&gt;
You know how scared I am of elevators&lt;br&gt;
Never trust it if it rises fast&lt;br&gt;
It can&amp;rsquo;t last&lt;br&gt;
Uh oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
Oh no I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love again&lt;br&gt;
Oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
I thought the plane was goin&amp;rsquo; down&lt;br&gt;
How&amp;rsquo;d you turn it right around?&lt;br&gt;
It only feels this raw right now&lt;br&gt;
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind&lt;br&gt;
Break up break free break through break down&lt;br&gt;
You would break your back&lt;br&gt;
To make me break a smile&lt;br&gt;
You know how much I hate&lt;br&gt;
That everybody just expects me to bounce back&lt;br&gt;
Just like that&lt;br&gt;
Uh oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
Oh no I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love again&lt;br&gt;
Oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
I thought the plane was goin&amp;rsquo; down&lt;br&gt;
How&amp;rsquo;d you turn it right around?&lt;br&gt;
Uh oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
Oh no I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love again&lt;br&gt;
Oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
I thought the plane was goin&amp;rsquo; down&lt;br&gt;
How&amp;rsquo;d you turn it right around?&lt;br&gt;
Uh oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
Oh no I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love again&lt;br&gt;
Oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
I thought the plane was goin&amp;rsquo; down&lt;br&gt;
How&amp;rsquo;d you turn it right around?&lt;br&gt;
Uh oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
Oh no I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love again&lt;br&gt;
Oh I&amp;rsquo;m fallin&amp;rsquo; in love&lt;br&gt;
I thought the plane was goin&amp;rsquo; down&lt;br&gt;
How&amp;rsquo;d you turn it right around?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this thing where I get older&lt;br&gt;
But just never wiser&lt;br&gt;
Midnights become my afternoons&lt;br&gt;
When my depression works the graveyard shift&lt;br&gt;
All of the people&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve ghosted stand there in the room&lt;br&gt;
I should not be left to my own devices&lt;br&gt;
They come with prices and vices&lt;br&gt;
I end up in crisis&lt;br&gt;
(Tale as old as time)&lt;br&gt;
I wake up screaming from dreaming&lt;br&gt;
One day I&amp;rsquo;ll watch as you&amp;rsquo;re leaving&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause you got tired of my scheming&lt;br&gt;
(For the last time)&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s me hi&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m the problem it&amp;rsquo;s me&lt;br&gt;
At teatime everybody agrees&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll stare directly at the sun&lt;br&gt;
But never in the mirror&lt;br&gt;
It must be exhausting&lt;br&gt;
Always rooting for the anti hero&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;m a monster on the hill&lt;br&gt;
Too big to hang out&lt;br&gt;
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city&lt;br&gt;
Pierced through the heart but never killed&lt;br&gt;
Did you hear my covert narcissism&lt;br&gt;
I disguise as altruism&lt;br&gt;
Like some kind of congressman?&lt;br&gt;
(A tale as old as time)&lt;br&gt;
I wake up screaming from dreaming&lt;br&gt;
One day I&amp;rsquo;ll watch as you&amp;rsquo;re leaving&lt;br&gt;
And life will lose all its meaning&lt;br&gt;
(For the last time)&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s me hi&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m the problem it&amp;rsquo;s me&lt;br&gt;
(I&amp;rsquo;m the problem it&amp;rsquo;s me)&lt;br&gt;
At teatime everybody agrees&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll stare directly at the sun&lt;br&gt;
But never in the mirror&lt;br&gt;
It must be exhausting&lt;br&gt;
Always rooting for the anti hero&lt;br&gt;
I have this dream my daughter in law kills me&lt;br&gt;
For the money&lt;br&gt;
She thinks I left them in the will&lt;br&gt;
The family gathers around and reads it&lt;br&gt;
And then someone screams out&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;She&amp;rsquo;s laughing up at us from hell&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s me hi&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m the problem it&amp;rsquo;s me&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s me hi&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m the problem it&amp;rsquo;s me&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s me hi&lt;br&gt;
Everybody agrees everybody agrees&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s me hi(Hi)&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m the problem it&amp;rsquo;s me(I&amp;rsquo;m the problem it&amp;rsquo;s me)&lt;br&gt;
At teatime(Teatime)&lt;br&gt;
Everybody agrees(Everybody agrees)&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll stare directly at the sun&lt;br&gt;
But never in the mirror&lt;br&gt;
It must be exhausting&lt;br&gt;
Always rooting for the anti hero&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baby love I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little too kind&lt;br&gt;
Didn&amp;rsquo;t notice you walkin&amp;rsquo; all over&lt;br&gt;
My peace of mind&lt;br&gt;
In the shoes I gave you as a present&lt;br&gt;
Puttin&amp;rsquo; someone first only works&lt;br&gt;
When you&amp;rsquo;re in their top five&lt;br&gt;
And by the way I&amp;rsquo;m goin&amp;rsquo; out tonight&lt;br&gt;
Best believe I&amp;rsquo;m still bejeweled&lt;br&gt;
When I walk in the room&lt;br&gt;
I can still make the whole place shimmer&lt;br&gt;
And when I meet the band&lt;br&gt;
They ask &amp;lsquo;do you have a man?&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
I could still say &amp;lsquo;i don&amp;rsquo;t remember&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
Familiarity breeds contempt&lt;br&gt;
So put me in the basement&lt;br&gt;
When I want the penthouse of your heart&lt;br&gt;
Diamonds in my eyes&lt;br&gt;
I polish up real I polish up real nice&lt;br&gt;
Nice&lt;br&gt;
Baby boy I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been too good of a girl&lt;br&gt;
(Too good of a girl)&lt;br&gt;
Did all the extra credit&lt;br&gt;
Then got graded on a curve&lt;br&gt;
I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to teach some lessons&lt;br&gt;
I made you my world(Huh)&lt;br&gt;
Have you heard?(Huh)&lt;br&gt;
I can reclaim the land&lt;br&gt;
And I miss you(Miss you)&lt;br&gt;
But I miss sparklin&amp;rsquo;(Nice)&lt;br&gt;
Best believe I&amp;rsquo;m still bejeweled&lt;br&gt;

I can still make the whole place shimmer&lt;br&gt;

Diamonds in my eyes&lt;br&gt;
I polish up real I polish up real nice&lt;br&gt;
Nice&lt;br&gt;
Sapphire tears on my face&lt;br&gt;
Sadness became my whole sky&lt;br&gt;
But some guy said my aura&amp;rsquo;s moonstone&lt;br&gt;
Just &amp;lsquo;cause he was high&lt;br&gt;
And we danced all night&lt;br&gt;
And you can try to change my mind&lt;br&gt;
But you might have to wait in line&lt;br&gt;
What&amp;rsquo;s a girl gonna do?&lt;br&gt;
A diamond&amp;rsquo;s gotta shine&lt;br&gt;
Best believe I&amp;rsquo;m still bejeweled&lt;br&gt;
When I walk in the room&lt;br&gt;
I can still make the whole place shimmer&lt;br&gt;
(Shimmer)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet me at midnight&lt;br&gt;
Staring at the ceiling with you&lt;br&gt;
Oh you don&amp;rsquo;t ever say too much&lt;br&gt;
And you don&amp;rsquo;t really read into&lt;br&gt;
My melancholia&lt;br&gt;
I been under scrutiny(Yeah oh yeah)&lt;br&gt;

The only kinda girl they see&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the morning came&lt;br&gt;
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause we lost track of time again&lt;br&gt;
Laughing with my feet in your lap&lt;br&gt;
Like you were my closest friend&lt;br&gt;
How&amp;rsquo;d we end up on the floor anyway?&lt;br&gt;
You say&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Your roommate&amp;rsquo;s cheap ass screw top rose&lt;br&gt;
that&amp;rsquo;s how&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
I see you every day now&lt;br&gt;
And I chose you&lt;br&gt;
The one I was dancing with&lt;br&gt;
In New York no shoes&lt;br&gt;
Looked up at the sky and it was&lt;br&gt;
The burgundy on my t shirt&lt;br&gt;
When you splashed your wine into me&lt;br&gt;
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks&lt;br&gt;
So scarlet it was&lt;br&gt;
The mark they saw on my collarbone&lt;br&gt;
The rust that grew between telephones&lt;br&gt;
The lips I used to call home&lt;br&gt;
So scarlet it was maroon&lt;br&gt;
When the silence came&lt;br&gt;
We were shaking blind and hazy&lt;br&gt;
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?&lt;br&gt;
Sobbing with your head in your hands&lt;br&gt;
Ain&amp;rsquo;t that the way shit always ends?&lt;br&gt;
You were standing hollow eyed in the hallway&lt;br&gt;
Carnations you had thought were roses&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s us&lt;br&gt;
I feel you no matter what&lt;br&gt;
The rubies that I gave up&lt;br&gt;
And I lost you&lt;br&gt;
The one I was dancing with&lt;br&gt;
In New York no shoes&lt;br&gt;
Looked up at the sky and it was(Maroon)&lt;br&gt;
The burgundy on my t shirt&lt;br&gt;
When you splashed your wine into me&lt;br&gt;
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks&lt;br&gt;
So scarlet it was(Maroon)&lt;br&gt;
The mark they saw on my collarbone&lt;br&gt;
The rust that grew between telephones&lt;br&gt;
The lips I used to call home&lt;br&gt;
So scarlet it was maroon&lt;br&gt;
And I wake with your memory over me&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s a real fucking legacy legacy&lt;br&gt;
(It was maroon)&lt;br&gt;
And I wake with your memory over me&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s a real fucking legacy to leave&lt;br&gt;
The burgundy on my t shirt&lt;br&gt;
When you splashed your wine into me&lt;br&gt;
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks&lt;br&gt;
So scarlet it was maroon&lt;br&gt;
The mark they saw on my collarbone&lt;br&gt;
The rust that grew between telephones&lt;br&gt;
The lips I used to call home&lt;br&gt;
So scarlet it was maroon&lt;br&gt;
It was maroon&lt;br&gt;
It was maroon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember&lt;br&gt;
Good girl sad boy&lt;br&gt;
Big city wrong choices&lt;br&gt;
We had one thing goin&amp;rsquo; on&lt;br&gt;
I swear that it was somethin&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause I don&amp;rsquo;t remember who I was&lt;br&gt;
Before you painted all my nights&lt;br&gt;
A color I&amp;rsquo;ve searched for since&lt;br&gt;
But one thing after another&lt;br&gt;
Fuckin&amp;rsquo; situations circumstances&lt;br&gt;
Miscommunications and I&lt;br&gt;
Have to say by the way&lt;br&gt;
I just may like some explanations&lt;br&gt;
Can I ask you a question?&lt;br&gt;
Did you ever have someone kiss you&lt;br&gt;
In a crowded room&lt;br&gt;
And every single&lt;br&gt;
One of your friends was makin&amp;rsquo; fun of you&lt;br&gt;
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin&amp;rsquo; too?&lt;br&gt;
Then what did you do?&lt;br&gt;
Did you leave her house&lt;br&gt;
In the middle of the night? Oh&lt;br&gt;
Did you wish you&amp;rsquo;d put up more of a fight oh&lt;br&gt;
When she said it was too much?&lt;br&gt;
Do you wish you could still touch her?&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s just a question&lt;br&gt;
Half moon eyes bad surprise&lt;br&gt;
Did you realize out of time?&lt;br&gt;
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy&lt;br&gt;
That you saw that night&lt;br&gt;
But you were on somethin&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
It was one drink after another&lt;br&gt;
Fuckin&amp;rsquo; politics and gender roles&lt;br&gt;
And you&amp;rsquo;re not sure and I don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;br&gt;
Got swept away in the grey&lt;br&gt;
I just may like to have a conversation&lt;br&gt;
Can I ask you a question?&lt;br&gt;
Did you ever have someone kiss you&lt;br&gt;
In a crowded room&lt;br&gt;
And every single&lt;br&gt;
One of your friends was makin&amp;rsquo; fun of you&lt;br&gt;
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin&amp;rsquo; too?&lt;br&gt;
Then what did you do?&lt;br&gt;
Did you leave her house&lt;br&gt;
In the middle of the night? Oh&lt;br&gt;
Did you wish you&amp;rsquo;d put up more of a fight oh&lt;br&gt;
When she said it was too much?&lt;br&gt;
Do you wish you could still touch her?&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s just a question&lt;br&gt;
Does it feel like everything&amp;rsquo;s just like&lt;br&gt;
Second best after that meteor strike?&lt;br&gt;
And what&amp;rsquo;s that that I heard?&lt;br&gt;
That you&amp;rsquo;re still with her?&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s nice I&amp;rsquo;m sure that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s suitable&lt;br&gt;
And right but tonight&lt;br&gt;
Can I ask you a question?&lt;br&gt;
(Can I ask you a question?)&lt;br&gt;
Did you ever have someone kiss you&lt;br&gt;
In a crowded room(In a crowded room)&lt;br&gt;
And every single&lt;br&gt;
One of your friends was makin&amp;rsquo; fun of you&lt;br&gt;
(Makin&amp;rsquo; fun of you)&lt;br&gt;
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin&amp;rsquo; too?&lt;br&gt;
Then what did you do?(Do)&lt;br&gt;
Did you leave her house&lt;br&gt;
In the middle of the night? Oh&lt;br&gt;
Did you wish you&amp;rsquo;d put up more of a fight&lt;br&gt;
Oh(More of a fight)&lt;br&gt;
When she said it was too much?&lt;br&gt;
Do you wish you could still touch her?&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s just a question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night a few moons ago&lt;br&gt;
I saw flecks of what could&amp;rsquo;ve been lights&lt;br&gt;
But it might just have been you&lt;br&gt;
Passing by unbeknownst to me&lt;br&gt;
Life is emotionally abusive&lt;br&gt;
And time can&amp;rsquo;t stop me quite like you did&lt;br&gt;
And my flight was awful thanks for asking&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m unglued thanks to you&lt;br&gt;
And it&amp;rsquo;s like snow at the beach&lt;br&gt;
Weird but fucking beautiful&lt;br&gt;
Flying in a dream&lt;br&gt;
Stars by the pocketful&lt;br&gt;
You wanting me&lt;br&gt;
Tonight feels impossible&lt;br&gt;
But it&amp;rsquo;s coming down&lt;br&gt;
No sound it&amp;rsquo;s all around&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach&lt;br&gt;
Like snow ah&lt;br&gt;
This scene feels like&lt;br&gt;
What I once saw on a screen&lt;br&gt;
I searched &amp;lsquo;aurora borealis green&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen someone lit from within&lt;br&gt;
Blurring out my periphery&lt;br&gt;
My smile is like I won a contest&lt;br&gt;
And to hide that would be so dishonest&lt;br&gt;
And it&amp;rsquo;s fine to fake it &amp;rsquo;til you make it&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Til you do &amp;rsquo;til it&amp;rsquo;s true&lt;br&gt;
Now it&amp;rsquo;s like snow at the beach&lt;br&gt;
Weird but fucking beautiful&lt;br&gt;
Flying in a dream&lt;br&gt;
Stars by the pocketful&lt;br&gt;
You wanting me&lt;br&gt;
Tonight feels impossible&lt;br&gt;
But it&amp;rsquo;s coming down&lt;br&gt;
No sound it&amp;rsquo;s all around&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach&lt;br&gt;
Like snow ah&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t speak afraid to jinx it&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t even dare to wish it&lt;br&gt;
But your eyes are flying saucers&lt;br&gt;
From another planet&lt;br&gt;
Now I&amp;rsquo;m all for you like Janet&lt;br&gt;
Can this be a real thing? Can it?&lt;br&gt;
Are we falling like snow at the beach?&lt;br&gt;
(Snow at the beach)&lt;br&gt;
Weird but fucking beautiful&lt;br&gt;
Flying in a dream(Flying in a dream)&lt;br&gt;
Stars by the pocketful&lt;br&gt;
You wanting me(You wanting me)&lt;br&gt;
Tonight feels impossible&lt;br&gt;
But it&amp;rsquo;s coming down&lt;br&gt;
No sound it&amp;rsquo;s all around&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach(Snow on the beach)&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach(Snow on the beach)&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach(Snow on the beach)&lt;br&gt;
Like snow ah&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s coming down&lt;br&gt;
No sound it&amp;rsquo;s all around&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach&lt;br&gt;
(It&amp;rsquo;s coming down it&amp;rsquo;s coming down)&lt;br&gt;
(It&amp;rsquo;s coming down it&amp;rsquo;s coming down)&lt;br&gt;
Like snow on the beach&lt;br&gt;
(It&amp;rsquo;s coming down it&amp;rsquo;s coming down)&lt;br&gt;
(It&amp;rsquo;s coming down it&amp;rsquo;s coming down)&lt;br&gt;
(It&amp;rsquo;s coming down it&amp;rsquo;s coming down)&lt;br&gt;
(It&amp;rsquo;s coming down it&amp;rsquo;s coming down)&lt;br&gt;
(It&amp;rsquo;s coming down it&amp;rsquo;s coming down)&lt;br&gt;
(It&amp;rsquo;s coming down it&amp;rsquo;s coming down)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer went away still the yearning stays&lt;br&gt;
I play it cool with the best of them&lt;br&gt;
I wait patiently he&amp;rsquo;s gonna notice me&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s okay we&amp;rsquo;re the best of friends&lt;br&gt;
Anyway&lt;br&gt;
I hear it in your voice&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re smoking with your boys&lt;br&gt;
I touch my phone as if it&amp;rsquo;s your face&lt;br&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose this town I dream of getting out&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s just one who could make me stay&lt;br&gt;
All my days&lt;br&gt;
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes&lt;br&gt;
I waited ages to see you there&lt;br&gt;
I search the party of better bodies&lt;br&gt;
Just to learn that you never cared&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re on your own kid&lt;br&gt;
You always have been&lt;br&gt;
I see the great escape so long Daisy May&lt;br&gt;
I picked the petals he loves me not&lt;br&gt;
Something different bloomed&lt;br&gt;
Writing in my room&lt;br&gt;
I play my songs in the parking lot&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll run away&lt;br&gt;
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes&lt;br&gt;
I called a taxi to take me there&lt;br&gt;
I search the party of better bodies&lt;br&gt;
Just to learn that my dreams aren&amp;rsquo;t rare&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re on your own kid&lt;br&gt;
You always have been&lt;br&gt;
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes&lt;br&gt;
I gave my blood sweat and tears for this&lt;br&gt;
I hosted parties and starved my body&lt;br&gt;
Like I&amp;rsquo;d be saved by a perfect kiss&lt;br&gt;
The jokes weren&amp;rsquo;t funny I took the money&lt;br&gt;
My friends from home don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say&lt;br&gt;
I looked around in a blood soaked gown&lt;br&gt;
And I saw something they can&amp;rsquo;t take away&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause there were pages turned&lt;br&gt;
With the bridges burned&lt;br&gt;
Everything you lose is a step you take&lt;br&gt;
So make the friendship bracelets&lt;br&gt;
Take the moment and taste it&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve got no reason to be afraid&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re on your own kid&lt;br&gt;
Yeah you can face this&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re on your own kid&lt;br&gt;
You always have been&lt;/p&gt;
