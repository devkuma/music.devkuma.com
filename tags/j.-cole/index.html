                Cole Cole world yeah Let me take yall back man As I do so well Wasnt nothin like that Man it wasnt nothin like that first time She was in my math class Long hair brown skin with a fat xss Sat beside me used to laugh Had mad jokes The teacher always got mad So we passed notes It started off so innocent She had a vibe And a xigga started diggin it I was a youngin straight crushin Tryna play the xhit cool But a xigga couldnt wait to get to school Cause when I seen em thighs on her And them hips on her and them lips on her Got me daydreaming man what Im thinkin how she rides on it If she sits on it if she licks on it Make it hard for me to stand up As time goes by Attractions getting deep and Wet dreaming thinkin that Im smashin But Im sleepin I want it bad And I aint never been obsessed before She wrote a note that said You ever had sex before xamn And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no I wrote back and said Of course I had sex before Knowing I was frontin I said Im like a pro baby Knowing I was stuntin But if I told the truth I knew that Id get played out son Hadnt been in pussy Since the day I came out one But she dont know that So she done wrote back and told me Oh you a pro homie Well I want you to show me My mama gone for the weekend So Saturday baby we can get to freakin Thats when my heart start racing And my body start sweatin Baby you done woke my lil man up Im thinking how that body look naked When you laying on the bed Teacher please dont make me stand up I wrote back like yeah baby sound like a plan Still trying to play it cool Sound like the man But I was scared to death My xigga my stomach turnin Talking xhit knowing xamn Well I was a virgin xuck And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no You know that feeling when you know You finna bone for the first time Im hoping that she wont notice Its my first time Im hoping that My xhit is big enough to xuck with And most of all Im praying God dont let me bust quick Im watching pornos Trying to see just how to stroke right Practice putting condoms on How it go right Im in her crib Now a xigga palms sweatin With a pocket full of rubbers And an erection Thats when my hands start touchin And her face start blushin And a xigga roll over on top And then she get my pants unbuckled And her hands start rubbin on me Woo girl dont stop its time for action Pull out the condoms real smooth Yeah just how I practiced But right before I put it in She flinched and grabbed it And said I wanna get Something off my mental I can tell youre a pro But baby be gentle cause Cause I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no And I aint never did this before no
