        &lt;p&gt;My first kiss went a&lt;br&gt;
little like this&lt;br&gt;
And twist&lt;br&gt;
and twist&lt;br&gt;
Well my&lt;br&gt;
first kiss&lt;br&gt;
Went a little&lt;br&gt;
like this&lt;br&gt;
And twist&lt;br&gt;
and twist&lt;br&gt;
I said&lt;br&gt;
no more teachers&lt;br&gt;
And no more&lt;br&gt;
books&lt;br&gt;
I got a kiss&lt;br&gt;
under the bleachers&lt;br&gt;
Hoping that&lt;br&gt;
nobody looks&lt;br&gt;
Lips like liquorish&lt;br&gt;
tongue like candy&lt;br&gt;
Excuse me&lt;br&gt;
Miss&lt;br&gt;
But can I get you out&lt;br&gt;
your panties&lt;br&gt;
In the back of the car&lt;br&gt;
on the way to the bar&lt;br&gt;
I got you on my list&lt;br&gt;
(I got you on my list)&lt;br&gt;
At the foot of&lt;br&gt;
the stairs&lt;br&gt;
With my fingers&lt;br&gt;
in your hair&lt;br&gt;
Baby&lt;br&gt;
this is it&lt;br&gt;
She won&amp;rsquo;t ever&lt;br&gt;
get enough&lt;br&gt;
Once she gets a&lt;br&gt;
little touch&lt;br&gt;
If I had it&lt;br&gt;
my way&lt;br&gt;
You know that I&amp;rsquo;d make&lt;br&gt;
her say woo woo&lt;br&gt;
She won&amp;rsquo;t ever&lt;br&gt;
get enough&lt;br&gt;
Once she gets a&lt;br&gt;
little touch&lt;br&gt;
If I had it&lt;br&gt;
my way&lt;br&gt;
You know that I&amp;rsquo;d make&lt;br&gt;
her say woo woo&lt;br&gt;
Well my&lt;br&gt;
first kiss&lt;br&gt;
Went a little&lt;br&gt;
like this&lt;br&gt;
I said no more sailors&lt;br&gt;
and no more soldiers&lt;br&gt;
Just with your name&lt;br&gt;
in a heart&lt;br&gt;
Tattooed up&lt;br&gt;
on the shoulders&lt;br&gt;
Your kiss is&lt;br&gt;
like whiskey&lt;br&gt;
It get&amp;rsquo;s me&lt;br&gt;
drunk&lt;br&gt;
And I wake up&lt;br&gt;
in the morning&lt;br&gt;
With the taste of&lt;br&gt;
your tongue&lt;br&gt;
In the back of the car&lt;br&gt;
on the way to the bar&lt;br&gt;
I got you on my list&lt;br&gt;
(I got you on my list)&lt;br&gt;
At the foot of&lt;br&gt;
the stairs&lt;br&gt;
With my fingers&lt;br&gt;
in your hair&lt;br&gt;
Baby&lt;br&gt;
this is it&lt;br&gt;
She won&amp;rsquo;t ever&lt;br&gt;
get enough&lt;br&gt;
Once she gets a&lt;br&gt;
little touch&lt;br&gt;
If I had it&lt;br&gt;
my way&lt;br&gt;
You know that I&amp;rsquo;d make&lt;br&gt;
her say woo woo&lt;br&gt;
She won&amp;rsquo;t ever&lt;br&gt;
get enough&lt;br&gt;
Once she gets a&lt;br&gt;
little touch&lt;br&gt;
If I had it&lt;br&gt;
my way&lt;br&gt;
You know that I&amp;rsquo;d make&lt;br&gt;
her say woo woo&lt;br&gt;
My first kiss went a&lt;br&gt;
little like this&lt;br&gt;
And twist&lt;br&gt;
and twist&lt;br&gt;
Well my&lt;br&gt;
first kiss&lt;br&gt;
Went a little&lt;br&gt;
like this&lt;br&gt;
And twist&lt;br&gt;
and twist&lt;br&gt;
She won&amp;rsquo;t ever&lt;br&gt;
get enough&lt;br&gt;
Once she gets a&lt;br&gt;

She won&amp;rsquo;t ever&lt;br&gt;

little touch&lt;br&gt;
If I had it&lt;br&gt;

She won&amp;rsquo;t ever&lt;br&gt;

Once she gets a&lt;br&gt;
little touch&lt;br&gt;
If I had it&lt;br&gt;
my way&lt;br&gt;
You know that&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d make her say&lt;/p&gt;
