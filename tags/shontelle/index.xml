        &lt;p&gt;I remember&lt;br&gt;
years ago&lt;br&gt;
Someone told me&lt;br&gt;
I should take&lt;br&gt;
Caution when it&lt;br&gt;
comes to love&lt;br&gt;
I did&lt;br&gt;
I did&lt;br&gt;
And you were strong&lt;br&gt;
and I was not&lt;br&gt;
My illusion&lt;br&gt;
my mistake&lt;br&gt;
I was careless&lt;br&gt;
I forgot I did&lt;br&gt;
And now&lt;br&gt;
when all is done&lt;br&gt;
There is&lt;br&gt;
nothing to say&lt;br&gt;
You have gone and&lt;br&gt;
so effortlessly&lt;br&gt;
You have won you can&lt;br&gt;
go ahead tell them&lt;br&gt;
Tell them&lt;br&gt;
all I know now&lt;br&gt;
Shout it&lt;br&gt;
from the roof tops&lt;br&gt;
Write it&lt;br&gt;
on the skyline&lt;br&gt;
All we had is&lt;br&gt;
gone now&lt;br&gt;
Tell them I was happy&lt;br&gt;
and my heart is broken&lt;br&gt;
All my&lt;br&gt;
scars are open&lt;br&gt;
Tell them what I hoped&lt;br&gt;
would be&lt;br&gt;
Impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
Falling out of&lt;br&gt;
love is hard&lt;br&gt;
Falling for&lt;br&gt;
betrayal is worst&lt;br&gt;
Broken trust&lt;br&gt;
and broken hearts&lt;br&gt;
I know&lt;br&gt;
I know&lt;br&gt;
Thinking all you&lt;br&gt;
need is there&lt;br&gt;
Building faith on&lt;br&gt;
love and words&lt;br&gt;
Empty promises will&lt;br&gt;
wear I know I know&lt;br&gt;
And now&lt;br&gt;
when all is gone&lt;br&gt;
There is&lt;br&gt;
nothing to say&lt;br&gt;
And if you&amp;rsquo;re done&lt;br&gt;
with embarrassing me&lt;br&gt;
On your own you can&lt;br&gt;
go ahead tell them&lt;br&gt;
Tell them&lt;br&gt;
all I know now&lt;br&gt;
Shout it&lt;br&gt;
from the roof tops&lt;br&gt;
Write it&lt;br&gt;
on the skyline&lt;br&gt;
All we had is&lt;br&gt;
gone now&lt;br&gt;
Tell them I was happy&lt;br&gt;
and my heart is broken&lt;br&gt;
All my&lt;br&gt;
scars are open&lt;br&gt;
Tell them what I hoped&lt;br&gt;
would be&lt;br&gt;
Impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
Impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
Oh impossible&lt;br&gt;
yeah yeah&lt;br&gt;
I remember&lt;br&gt;
years ago&lt;br&gt;
Someone told me&lt;br&gt;
I should take&lt;br&gt;
Caution when it&lt;br&gt;
comes to love I did&lt;br&gt;
Tell them&lt;br&gt;
all I know now&lt;br&gt;
Shout it&lt;br&gt;
from the roof tops&lt;br&gt;

on the skyline&lt;br&gt;
All we had is&lt;br&gt;
gone now&lt;br&gt;
Tell them I was happy&lt;br&gt;
and my heart is broken&lt;br&gt;
All my&lt;br&gt;
scars are open&lt;br&gt;
Tell them what I hoped&lt;br&gt;
would be&lt;br&gt;
Impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
Impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
impossible impossible&lt;br&gt;
I remember&lt;br&gt;
years ago&lt;br&gt;
Someone told me&lt;br&gt;
I should take&lt;br&gt;
Caution when it&lt;br&gt;
comes to love I did&lt;/p&gt;
