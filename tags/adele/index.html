                I will leave my heart at the door I wont say a word Theyve all been said before you know So why dont we just play pretend Like were not scared of what is coming next Or scared of having nothing left  Look dont get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is  If this is my last night with you Hold me like Im more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again  I dont need your honesty Its already in your eyes And Im sure my eyes they speak for me No one knows me like you do And since youre the only one that matters Tell me who do I run to  Look dont get me wrong I know there is no tomorrow All I ask is  If this is my last night with you Hold me like Im more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again  Let this be our lesson in love Let this be the way we remember us I dont wanna be cruel or vicious And I aint asking for forgiveness All I ask is  If this is my last night with you Hold me like Im more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again  All I Ask Adele

                I thought I told you Hed be home soon Couldnt help myself Youre too good to be true I fall short each time Every time he aint here You and your charm creep closer Closer in here Like a fool for fire I fall With my pride and all Like a bomb before explosion Ticking by your call Youre the wiser one Disguised from greed And Im just a child Who longs on her knees But I found a boy who I love more Than I ever did you before So stand beside the river I cried And let yourself down Look how you want me now That I dont need you So you thought that I crumble To my knees at the first sight Of you crawling back to me To whisper Will you leave your man Cause you swear that this time You can stand by me I wont stand by you Cause I found a boy who I love more Than I ever did you before So stand beside the river I cried And let yourself down Look how you want me now That I dont need you I aint yours for no taking You must be mistaken I could never look into your eyes And stand for wrong and ignore who I Well I found a boy who loves me more Than you ever did before So stand beside the river you cried And let yourself down Look how you want me now That I dont need you

                Hello its me I was wondering if after All these years youd like to meet To go over everything They say that times supposed to heal ya But I aint done much healing Hello can you hear me Im in California dreaming about Who we used to be When we were younger and free Ive forgotten how it felt Before the world fell at our feet Theres such a difference Between us and a million miles Hello from the other side I mustve called a thousand times To tell you Im sorry For everything that Ive done But when I call you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least I can say that Ive tried To tell you Im sorry For breaking your heart But it dont matter it clearly Doesnt tear you apart anymore Hello how are you its so typical of me To talk about myself Im sorry I hope that youre well Did you ever make it out of that town Where nothing ever happened Its no secret that the both of us Are running out of time So hello from the other side I mustve called a thousand times To tell you Im sorry For everything that Ive done But when I call you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least I can say that Ive tried To tell you Im sorry For breaking your heart But it dont matter it clearly Doesnt tear you apart anymore Woo anymore woo anymore Woo anymore anymore woo Hello from the other side I mustve called a thousand times To tell you Im sorry For everything that Ive done But when I call you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least I can say that Ive tried To tell you Im sorry For breaking your heart But it dont matter it clearly Doesnt tear you apart anymore

                There aint no gold in this river That Ive been washin my hands in forever I know there is hope in these waters But I cant bring myself to swim When I am drowning in this silence Baby let me in Go easy on me baby I was still a child Didnt get the chance to Feel the world around me I had no time to choose What I chose to do so go easy on me There aint no room for things to change When we are both so deeply Stuck in our ways You cant deny how hard I have tried I changed who I was to put you both first But now I give up Go easy on me baby I was still a child Didnt get the chance to Feel the world around me Had no time to choose What I chose to do so go easy on me I had good intentions and the highest hopes But I know right now It probably doesnt even show Go easy on me baby I was still a child I didnt get the chance to Feel the world around me I had no time to choose What I chose to do so go easy on me

                When will I see you again You left with no goodbye Not a single word was said No final kiss to seal any seams I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart And a bitterness and a wandering eye And a heaviness in my head But dont you remember dont you remember The reason you loved me before Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me Or have you completely Erased me from your memory I often think about where I went wrong The more I do the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart And a bitterness and a wandering eye And a heaviness in my head But dont you remember dont you remember The reason you loved me before Baby please remember me once more Gave you the space so you could breathe I kept my distance so you would be free And hope that you find the missing piece To bring you back to me Why dont you remember dont you remember The reason you loved me before Baby please remember me once more When will I see you again

                I will leave my heart at the door I wont say a word Theyve all been said before you know So why dont we just play pretend Like were not scared of what is coming next Or scared of having nothing left Look dont get me wrong I know There is no tomorrow all I ask Is if this is my last night with you Hold me like Im more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand While we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again I dont need your honesty Its already in your eyes And Im sure my eyes they speak for me No one knows me like you do And since youre The only one that mattered Tell me who do I run to Look dont get me wrong I know There is no tomorrow all I ask Is if this is my last night with you Hold me like Im more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand While we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again Let this be our lesson in love Let this be the way we remember us I dont wanna be cruel or vicious And I aint asking For forgiveness all I ask Is if this is my last night with you Hold me like Im more than just a friend Give me a memory I can use Take me by the hand While we do what lovers do It matters how this ends Cause what if I never love again
