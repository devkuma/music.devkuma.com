&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Christmas I gave you my heart&lt;br&gt;
But the very next day you gave it away&lt;br&gt;
This year to save me from tears&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll give it to someone special&lt;br&gt;
Last Christmas I gave you my heart&lt;br&gt;
But the very next day you gave it away&lt;br&gt;
This year to save me from tears&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll give it to someone special(Special)&lt;br&gt;
Once bitten and twice shy&lt;br&gt;
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye&lt;br&gt;
Tell me baby do you recognize me?&lt;br&gt;
Well it&amp;rsquo;s been a year it doesn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me&lt;br&gt;
Happy Christmas I wrapped it up and sеnt it&lt;br&gt;
With a note saying I love you I meant it&lt;br&gt;
Now I know what a fool I&amp;rsquo;ve been&lt;br&gt;
But if you kissed me now&lt;br&gt;
I know you&amp;rsquo;d fool me again&lt;br&gt;
Last Christmas I gave you my heart&lt;br&gt;
But the very next day you gave it away&lt;br&gt;
This year to save me from tears&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll give it to someone special(Special)&lt;br&gt;
Last Christmas&lt;br&gt;
I gave you my heart(Gave you my heart)&lt;br&gt;
But the very next day&lt;br&gt;
You gave it away(Gave it away)&lt;br&gt;
This year to save me from tears&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll give it to someone special(Special)&lt;br&gt;
A crowded room friends with tired eyes&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m hiding from you and your soul of ice&lt;br&gt;
My God I thought you were someone to rely on&lt;br&gt;
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on&lt;br&gt;
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart&lt;br&gt;
A man undercover&lt;br&gt;
But you tore me apart(Oh oh)&lt;br&gt;
Now I&amp;rsquo;ve found a real love&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll never fool me again&lt;br&gt;
Last Christmas&lt;br&gt;
I gave you my heart(I gave you my heart)&lt;br&gt;
But the very next day&lt;br&gt;
You gave it away(You gave it away)&lt;br&gt;
This year to save me from tears&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll give it to someone special(Special)&lt;br&gt;
Last Christmas&lt;br&gt;
I gave you my heart(I gave you my heart)&lt;br&gt;
But the very next day&lt;br&gt;
You gave it away(You gave it away)&lt;br&gt;
This year to save me from tears&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll give it to someone special special&lt;br&gt;
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart&lt;br&gt;
A man under cover&lt;br&gt;
But you tore him apart(Tore me apart)&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it to someone special special&lt;br&gt;
So long&lt;/p&gt;
