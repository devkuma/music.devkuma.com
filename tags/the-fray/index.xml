        &lt;p&gt;Step one you say&lt;br&gt;
we need to talk&lt;br&gt;
He walks&lt;br&gt;
you say sit down&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s just a talk&lt;br&gt;
he smiles politely&lt;br&gt;
Back at you&lt;br&gt;
you stare politely&lt;br&gt;
Right on through&lt;br&gt;
some sort of&lt;br&gt;
Window to your right&lt;br&gt;
as he goes left&lt;br&gt;
And you stay right&lt;br&gt;
between the lines of&lt;br&gt;
Fear and blame&lt;br&gt;
and you begin to&lt;br&gt;
Wonder why&lt;br&gt;
you came&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let him know&lt;br&gt;
that you know best&lt;br&gt;
Cause after all&lt;br&gt;
you do know best&lt;br&gt;
Try to slip past&lt;br&gt;
his defense&lt;br&gt;
Without granting&lt;br&gt;
innocence&lt;br&gt;
Lay down a list of&lt;br&gt;
what is wrong&lt;br&gt;
The things you&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;br&gt;
told him all along&lt;br&gt;
And pray to God&lt;br&gt;
he hears you&lt;br&gt;
And pray to God&lt;br&gt;
he hears you&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
As he begins to&lt;br&gt;
raise his voice&lt;br&gt;
You lower yours&lt;br&gt;
and grant him one&lt;br&gt;
Last choice&lt;br&gt;
drive until&lt;br&gt;
You lose the road&lt;br&gt;
or break with&lt;br&gt;
The ones&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;ve followed&lt;br&gt;
He will do one of&lt;br&gt;
two things&lt;br&gt;
He will admit to&lt;br&gt;
everything&lt;br&gt;
Or he&amp;rsquo;ll say&lt;br&gt;
he&amp;rsquo;s just&lt;br&gt;
Not the same&lt;br&gt;
and you&amp;rsquo;ll begin to&lt;br&gt;
Wonder&lt;br&gt;
why you came&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
How to save a life&lt;br&gt;
how to save a life&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
How to save a life&lt;br&gt;
how to save a life&lt;/p&gt;
