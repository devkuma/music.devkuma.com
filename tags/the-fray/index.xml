        &lt;p&gt;작사: KING JOSEPH, SLADE ISAAC EDWARD&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=63144&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;63144&lt;/a&gt; / KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@TJKaraoke/search?query=21961&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;21961&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found God&lt;br&gt;
on the corner&lt;br&gt;
Of first and Amistad&lt;br&gt;
where the west&lt;br&gt;
Was all but won&lt;br&gt;
all alone&lt;br&gt;
Smoking&lt;br&gt;
his last cigarette&lt;br&gt;
I said&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;where you been&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
He said&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;ask anything&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Where&lt;br&gt;
were you&lt;br&gt;
When everything&lt;br&gt;
was falling apart&lt;br&gt;
All my days were spent&lt;br&gt;
by the telephone&lt;br&gt;
It never&lt;br&gt;
rang&lt;br&gt;
And all I needed&lt;br&gt;
was a call&lt;br&gt;
It never came&lt;br&gt;
to the corner&lt;br&gt;
Of first and Amistad&lt;br&gt;
lost and insecure&lt;br&gt;
You found me&lt;br&gt;
you found me&lt;br&gt;
Lying on the floor&lt;br&gt;
surrounded&lt;br&gt;
Surrounded&lt;br&gt;
why&amp;rsquo;d you have to wait&lt;br&gt;
Where were you&lt;br&gt;
where were you&lt;br&gt;
Just a little&lt;br&gt;
late&lt;br&gt;
You found me&lt;br&gt;
you found me&lt;br&gt;
In the end&lt;br&gt;
everyone&lt;br&gt;
Ends up alone&lt;br&gt;
losing her&lt;br&gt;
The only one&lt;br&gt;
who has ever known&lt;br&gt;
Who I am&lt;br&gt;
who I&amp;rsquo;m not&lt;br&gt;
Who I want to be&lt;br&gt;
no way to know&lt;br&gt;
How lost&lt;br&gt;
you will be&lt;br&gt;
Next to me&lt;br&gt;
lost and insecure&lt;br&gt;
You found me&lt;br&gt;
you found me&lt;br&gt;
Lying on the floor&lt;br&gt;
surrounded&lt;br&gt;
Surrounded&lt;br&gt;
why&amp;rsquo;d you have to wait&lt;br&gt;
Where were you&lt;br&gt;
where were you&lt;br&gt;
Just a little&lt;br&gt;
late&lt;br&gt;
You found me&lt;br&gt;
you found me&lt;br&gt;
Early morning&lt;br&gt;
the city breaks&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been&lt;br&gt;
calling&lt;br&gt;
For years and years&lt;br&gt;
and years and years&lt;br&gt;
And you never left me&lt;br&gt;
no messages&lt;br&gt;
And never sent me&lt;br&gt;
no letters&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve got&lt;br&gt;
some kind of nerve&lt;br&gt;
Taking all I want&lt;br&gt;
lost and insecure&lt;br&gt;
You found me&lt;br&gt;
you found me&lt;br&gt;
Lying on the floor&lt;br&gt;
where were you&lt;br&gt;
Where were you&lt;br&gt;
lost and insecure&lt;br&gt;
You found me&lt;br&gt;
you found me&lt;br&gt;
Lying on the floor&lt;br&gt;
surrounded&lt;br&gt;
Surrounded&lt;br&gt;
why&amp;rsquo;d you have to wait&lt;br&gt;
Where were you&lt;br&gt;
where were you&lt;br&gt;
Just a little late&lt;br&gt;
you found me&lt;br&gt;
You found me~&lt;br&gt;
why&amp;rsquo;d you have to wait&lt;br&gt;
To find me&lt;br&gt;
to find me&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;작곡: Sung by / 작사: Joe King, Isaac Slade&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=60229&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;60229&lt;/a&gt; / KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@TJKaraoke/search?query=21558&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;21558&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never knew&lt;br&gt;
I never knew&lt;br&gt;
That everything&lt;br&gt;
was falling through&lt;br&gt;
That everyone I knew&lt;br&gt;
was waiting on a queue&lt;br&gt;
To turn&lt;br&gt;
and run when all&lt;br&gt;
I needed&lt;br&gt;
was the truth&lt;br&gt;
But that&amp;rsquo;s how&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s got to be&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s coming&lt;br&gt;
down to nothing&lt;br&gt;
More than apathy&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d rather run&lt;br&gt;
The other way&lt;br&gt;
than stay and see&lt;br&gt;
The smoke and&lt;br&gt;
who&amp;rsquo;s still standing&lt;br&gt;
When it clears&lt;br&gt;
everyone knows&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m in over my head&lt;br&gt;
over my head&lt;br&gt;
With eight seconds&lt;br&gt;
left in overtime&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;s on your mind&lt;br&gt;
she&amp;rsquo;s on your mind&lt;br&gt;
Let&amp;rsquo;s rearrange I wish&lt;br&gt;
you were a stranger&lt;br&gt;
I could disengage&lt;br&gt;
just say that we agree&lt;br&gt;
And then never change&lt;br&gt;
soften a bit until&lt;br&gt;
We all just get along&lt;br&gt;
but that&amp;rsquo;s disregard&lt;br&gt;
You find&lt;br&gt;
another friend&lt;br&gt;
And you discard&lt;br&gt;
as you lose&lt;br&gt;
The argument&lt;br&gt;
in a cable car&lt;br&gt;
Hanging above&lt;br&gt;
as the&lt;br&gt;
Canyon comes&lt;br&gt;
between and&lt;br&gt;
Everyone knows&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m in&lt;br&gt;
Over my head&lt;br&gt;
over my head&lt;br&gt;
With eight seconds&lt;br&gt;
left in overtime&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;s on your mind&lt;br&gt;
she&amp;rsquo;s on your mind&lt;br&gt;
Everyone knows&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m in&lt;br&gt;
Over my head&lt;br&gt;
over my head&lt;br&gt;
With eight seconds&lt;br&gt;
left in overtime&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;s on your mind&lt;br&gt;
she&amp;rsquo;s on~&lt;br&gt;
And suddenly I become&lt;br&gt;
a part of your past&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m becoming the part&lt;br&gt;
that don&amp;rsquo;t last&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m losing you and&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s effortless&lt;br&gt;
Without a sound&lt;br&gt;
we lose sight&lt;br&gt;
Of the ground&lt;br&gt;
in the throw around&lt;br&gt;
Never thought&lt;br&gt;
that you wanted&lt;br&gt;
To bring it down&lt;br&gt;
I won&amp;rsquo;t let it go down&lt;br&gt;
Till we torch&lt;br&gt;
it ourselves&lt;br&gt;
Everyone knows&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m in&lt;br&gt;
Over my head&lt;br&gt;
over my head&lt;br&gt;
With eight seconds&lt;br&gt;
left in overtime&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;s on your mind&lt;br&gt;
she&amp;rsquo;s on your mind&lt;br&gt;
Everyone knows&lt;br&gt;
she&amp;rsquo;s on your mind&lt;br&gt;
Everyone knows&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m in&lt;br&gt;
Over my head&lt;br&gt;
everyone knows&lt;br&gt;
Over my head I&amp;rsquo;m in&lt;br&gt;
over my&lt;br&gt;
Everyone knows&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m in&lt;br&gt;
Over my head&lt;br&gt;
over my head&lt;br&gt;
With eight seconds&lt;br&gt;
left in overtime&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;s on your mind&lt;br&gt;
she&amp;rsquo;s on your mind~&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;작사: Joe King, Isaac Slade&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=60477&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;60477&lt;/a&gt; / KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@TJKaraoke/search?query=21699&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;21699&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step one you say&lt;br&gt;
we need to talk&lt;br&gt;
He walks&lt;br&gt;
you say sit down&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s just a talk&lt;br&gt;
he smiles politely&lt;br&gt;
Back at you&lt;br&gt;
you stare politely&lt;br&gt;
Right on through&lt;br&gt;
some sort of&lt;br&gt;
Window to your right&lt;br&gt;
as he goes left&lt;br&gt;
And you stay right&lt;br&gt;
between the lines of&lt;br&gt;
Fear and blame&lt;br&gt;
and you begin to&lt;br&gt;
Wonder why&lt;br&gt;
you came&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let him know&lt;br&gt;
that you know best&lt;br&gt;
Cause after all&lt;br&gt;
you do know best&lt;br&gt;
Try to slip past&lt;br&gt;
his defense&lt;br&gt;
Without granting&lt;br&gt;
innocence&lt;br&gt;
Lay down a list of&lt;br&gt;
what is wrong&lt;br&gt;
The things you&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;br&gt;
told him all along&lt;br&gt;
And pray to God&lt;br&gt;
he hears you&lt;br&gt;
And pray to God&lt;br&gt;
he hears you&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
As he begins to&lt;br&gt;
raise his voice&lt;br&gt;
You lower yours&lt;br&gt;
and grant him one&lt;br&gt;
Last choice&lt;br&gt;
drive until&lt;br&gt;
You lose the road&lt;br&gt;
or break with&lt;br&gt;
The ones&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;ve followed&lt;br&gt;
He will do one of&lt;br&gt;
two things&lt;br&gt;
He will admit to&lt;br&gt;
everything&lt;br&gt;
Or he&amp;rsquo;ll say&lt;br&gt;
he&amp;rsquo;s just&lt;br&gt;
Not the same&lt;br&gt;
and you&amp;rsquo;ll begin to&lt;br&gt;
Wonder&lt;br&gt;
why you came&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
How to save a life&lt;br&gt;
how to save a life&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
Where did I go wrong&lt;br&gt;
I lost a friend&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere along&lt;br&gt;
in the bitterness&lt;br&gt;
And I would have&lt;br&gt;
stayed up&lt;br&gt;
With you&lt;br&gt;
all night&lt;br&gt;
Had I known how&lt;br&gt;
to save a life&lt;br&gt;
How to save a life&lt;br&gt;
how to save a life&lt;/p&gt;
