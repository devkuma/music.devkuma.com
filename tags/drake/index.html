can make it rain all spring Yall seen my story my glory I had raped the game young You can call it statutory When a xigga blow up They gon build statues for me Old money Benjamin Button what nothing Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin You would think I ran the world Like Michelles husband You would think these xiggas know me When they really doesnt Like they was down with the old me no You xucking wasnt Youre such a xucking loser He didnt even go to class Bueller Trade the Grammy plaques Just to have my granny back Remember she had that bad hip Like a fanny pack chasing the stardom Will turn you to a maniac All the way in Hollywood And I cant even act They pull their cameras out And godxamn he snap I used to want this thing forever Yall can have it back It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine OK hello its the Martian Space Jam Jordans I want this xhit forever Wake up and smell the garden Fresher than the harvest Step up to the target if I had one guess Then I guess Im just New Orleans And I will never stop Like Im running from the cops Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur To the top life is such a xucking Roller coaster then it drops But what should I scream for This is my theme park my mind shine even When my thoughts seem dark Pistol on my side You dont wanna hear that thing talk Let the king talk check the price And pay attention Lil Wayne Thats what they gotta say or mention Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover Shhh my foots sleeping on the gas No brake pads no such thing as last uh It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine There they go packing stadiums As Shady spits his flow Nuts they go macadamian They go so ballistic whoa He can make them look like Bozos Hes wondering if he should spit this slow Xuck no go for broke His cup just runneth over oh no He aint had him a buzz like this Since the last time that he overdosed Theyve been waiting patiently For Pinocchio to poke his nose Back into the game and they know Rap will never be the same as before Bashing in the brains of these hoes And establishing the name as he goes The passion and the flame is ignited You cant put it out once we light it This xhit is exactly what the xuck That Im talking about when we riot You dealing with a few true villains Who stand inside of a booth truth spilling And spit true feelings until our tooth Fillings come flying up Out of our mouths now rewind it Pay back motherxucker for the way That you got at me hows it taste When I slap the taste out Your mouth with the bass so loud That it shakes the place Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case Youre thinking of saving face You aint gonna have no face to save By the time Im through With this place so Drake It may not mean nothing to yall But understand nothing was done for me So I dont plan on stopping at all I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine Im shutting xhit down in the mall And telling every girl she the one for me And I aint even planning to call I want this xhit forever mine Ever mine ever mine ever mine
