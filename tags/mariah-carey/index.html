                Ive seen the light in the sky In the skies are like fireflies Burnin bright Just to vanish in the dark Ive held hope in my two hands That there would be another chance To find the kingdom Im believin in my heart Cause underneath the good Theres something greater than you know When youre almost there And youre almost home Just open up your eyes and go go When youre almost there Almost home know youre not alone Youre almost home home When you run run so far Youve forgotten who you are Where youre from Its like some other universe You count your steps like theyre regrets You catch one breath then lose the rest Wrong is right right is left And theres nowhere left to turn So dont believe in everything You think you think you know When youre almost there And youre almost home Just open up your eyes and go go When youre almost there Almost home know youre not alone Youre almost home home When you let your heart be the compass You wont get lost not if you trust it When you hear the sound of the trumpet Louder than ever before Oh when youre almost there Almost home Just open up your eyes and go go Cause youre almost there Almost home know youre not alone Youre almost home home home home When youre almost there Almost home Just open up your eyes and go go Almost there Youre almost home know youre not alone Youre almost home home home home
