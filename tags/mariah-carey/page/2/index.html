                Ah When you love someone so deeply They become your life Its easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside Blindly I imagined I could Keep you under glass Now I understand to hold you I must open up my hands And watch you rise Spread your wings and prepare to fly For you have become a butterfly Oh Fly abandonedly into the sun If you should return to me We truly were meant to be So spread your wings and fly Butterfly I have learned that beauty Has to flourish in the light Wild horses run unbridled Or their spirit dies You have given me the courage To be all that I can And truly feel your heart will Lead you back to me when youre Ready to land Spread your wings and prepare to fly For you have become a butterfly Oh Fly abandonedly into the sun If you should return to me We truly were meant to be So spread your wings and fly Butterfly Ha I cant pretend these tears Arent overflowing steadily I cant prevent this hurt from Almost overtaking me But I will stand and say goodbye For youll never be mine Untill you know the way it feels to fly Spread your wings and prepare to fly For you have become a butterfly Oh Fly abandonedly into the sun If you should return to me We truly were meant to be So spread your wings and fly Butterfly Spread your wings and prepare to fly For you have become a butterfly Oh Fly abandonely into the sun If you should return to me We truly were meant to be So spread your wings and fly Butterfly So flutter through sky Butterfly Fly Spread your wings and fly Butterfly
