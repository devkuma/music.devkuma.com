                I shouldve known Id leave alone Just goes to show that the blood You bleed is just the blood you owe We were a pair but I saw you there Too much to bear you were my life But life is far away from fair Was I stupid to love you Was I reckless to help Was it obvious to everybody else That Id fallen for a lie You were never on my side Fool me once fool me twice Are you death or paradise Now youll never see me cry Theres just no time to die I let it burn Youre no longer my concern Faces from my past return Another lesson yet to learn That Id fallen for a lie You were never on my side Fool me once fool me twice Are you death or paradise Now youll never see me cry Theres just no time to die No time to die no time to die Fool me once fool me twice Are you death or paradise Now youll never see me cry Theres just no time to die

                Try not to abuse your power I know we didnt choose to change You might not wanna lose your power But having its so strange She said you were a hero You played the part But you ruined her in a year Dont act like it was hard And you swear you didnt know No wonder why you didnt ask She was sleeping in your clothes But now shes got to get to class How dare you and how could you Will you only feel bad when they find out If you could take it all back would you Try not to abuse your power I know we didnt choose to change You might not wanna lose your power But having its so strange I thought that I was special You made me feel like it was my fault You were the devil lost your appeal Does it keep you in control For you to keep her in a cage And you swear you didnt know You said you thought she was your age How dare you and how could you Will you only feel bad if it turns out That they kill your contract would you Try not to abuse your power I know we didnt choose to change You might not wanna lose your power But power isnt pain
