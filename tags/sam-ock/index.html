                I wish I could say That Im an honest human being That what youre really Seeing is the truth But times go and change I really dont know what Im feeling The one thing that I know is That Im with you I know theres pain Cause life it aint so easy And people go and leave you all alone And I cant complain Ive been blessed with many things And in the end I know that Ill be home Ill go home Let the bad times roll Cause Im with you and youre with me Let the bad times roll cause were together And thats all that matters to me And I gotta say fellowship in pain Is a kind that never fades away Which is why I dont fight it I let it come the peace I recieve When its over is a different one For the lack of better words Its intimate A bad time will show me All my pride and itll murder it Youve heard of it right The sound of a soul cry So much louder when theres Someone else by its side So my brothers and my sisters When you see it coming the wave of pain Stand firm stop your running I think we all agree That it cant be stopped But if we all hold our breath than How can we not Share in this connection This empathy so much stronger than Our good times through anything Personally I think that its a better day When the light shines And I see the darkness run away Let the bad times roll Cause Im with you and youre with me Let the bad times roll cause were together And thats all that matters to me  Sometimes they say About the things youre keepin You dont know what you got Until its gone But Im here to stay Of course until Im leaving Til life it calls it quits and then I fall I know theres a way to eternity in heaven For I will say that Jesus is my truth A smile on my face Yes thats what Ill be keeping When all is through Ill come home back to you Ill come home back to you Let the bad times roll Cause Im with you and youre with me Let the bad times roll cause were together And thats all that matters to me
