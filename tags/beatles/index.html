                Penny Lane there is a barber Showing photographs of every head Hes had the pleasure to know And all the people that come and go Stop and say hello On the corner is a banker With a motor car the little children Laugh at him behind his back And the banker never wears a mac In the pouring rain very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back In Penny Lane there is a fireman With an hourglass and in his pocket is A portrait of the queen He likes to keep his fire engine clean Its a clean machine  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes Four of fish and finger pies In summer meanwhile back Behind the shelter In the middle of the roundabout A pretty nurse is selling poppies From a tray and though she feels As if shes in a play she is anyway Penny Lane the barber shaves Another customer we see the banker Sitting waiting for a trim Then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes There beneath the blue suburban skies Penny Lane

                I read the news today oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well I just had to laugh I saw the photograph He blew his mind out in a car He didnt notice that The lights had changed A crowd of people stood and stared Theyd seen his face before Nobody was really sure If he was from the house of lords I saw a film today oh boy The English army had just won the war A crowd of people turned away But I just had to look Having read the book Id love to turn you on  Work up fell out of bed Dragged a comb across my head Found my way downstairs And drank a cup And looking up I noticed I was late Found my coat and grabbed my hat Made the bus in seconds flat Found my way upstairs and had a smoke And somebody spoke and I went into a dream Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I read the news today oh boy Four thousand holes In blackburn lancashire And though the holes were rather small They had to count them all Now they know how many holes It takes to fill the albert hall Id love to turn you on
