&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young man&lt;br&gt;
there&amp;rsquo;s no need to feel down&lt;br&gt;
I said young man&lt;br&gt;
pick yourself off the ground&lt;br&gt;
I said young man&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;cause you&amp;rsquo;re in a new town&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s no need to be unhappy&lt;br&gt;
Young man&lt;br&gt;
there&amp;rsquo;s a place you can go&lt;br&gt;
I said young man&lt;br&gt;
when you&amp;rsquo;re short on your dough&lt;br&gt;
You can stay there&lt;br&gt;
and I&amp;rsquo;m sure you will find&lt;br&gt;
Many ways to have a good time&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s fun to stay at the Y M C A&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s fun to stay at the Y M C A&lt;br&gt;

Young man&lt;br&gt;
are you listening to me&lt;br&gt;
I said young man&lt;br&gt;
what do you want to be&lt;br&gt;
I said young man&lt;br&gt;
you can make real your dreams&lt;br&gt;
But you got to know this one thing&lt;br&gt;
No man does it all by himself&lt;br&gt;
I said young man&lt;br&gt;
put your pride on the shelf&lt;br&gt;
And just go there to the Y M C A&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sure they can help you today&lt;br&gt;

Young man&lt;br&gt;
I was once in your shoes&lt;br&gt;
I said I was down and out with&lt;br&gt;
the blues&lt;br&gt;
I felt no man cared&lt;br&gt;
if I were alive&lt;br&gt;
I felt the whole world was so jive&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s when someone came up to me&lt;br&gt;
And said young man&lt;br&gt;
take a walk up the street&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;s a place there called the&lt;br&gt;
Y M C A&lt;br&gt;
They can start you back&lt;br&gt;
