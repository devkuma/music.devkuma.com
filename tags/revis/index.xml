        &lt;p&gt;Is it real?&lt;br&gt;
we&amp;rsquo;re always the same&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re almost&lt;br&gt;
undone now&lt;br&gt;
I was caught&lt;br&gt;
in the rain&lt;br&gt;
Wasting my time&lt;br&gt;
on the ground&lt;br&gt;
Waiting the call&lt;br&gt;
of what would you say&lt;br&gt;
And can you&lt;br&gt;
come over?&lt;br&gt;
I was caught&lt;br&gt;
in the rain&lt;br&gt;
Wasting my time&lt;br&gt;
on the ground&lt;br&gt;
It was you&lt;br&gt;
who could get me high&lt;br&gt;
With&lt;br&gt;
whatever you say&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re telling me&lt;br&gt;
something real&lt;br&gt;
What we do&lt;br&gt;
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter now&lt;br&gt;
Whatever&lt;br&gt;
it takes&lt;br&gt;
For you&lt;br&gt;
to stay with me&lt;br&gt;
Trading thoughts&lt;br&gt;
across from the room&lt;br&gt;
I saw&lt;br&gt;
you surrounded&lt;br&gt;
I was caught&lt;br&gt;
in the rain&lt;br&gt;
Wasting my time&lt;br&gt;
on the ground&lt;br&gt;
Feeling us fall&lt;br&gt;
without an escape&lt;br&gt;
I almost&lt;br&gt;
let you down&lt;br&gt;
I was caught&lt;br&gt;
in the rain&lt;br&gt;
Wasting my time&lt;br&gt;
on the ground&lt;br&gt;
It was you&lt;br&gt;
Who could get me high&lt;br&gt;
With&lt;br&gt;
whatever you say&lt;br&gt;
You tell me&lt;br&gt;
something real&lt;br&gt;
What we do&lt;br&gt;
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter now&lt;br&gt;
Whatever&lt;br&gt;
it takes&lt;br&gt;
For you&lt;br&gt;
to stay with me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was you&lt;br&gt;
who could get me high&lt;br&gt;
With&lt;br&gt;
whatever you say&lt;br&gt;
You tell me&lt;br&gt;
something real&lt;br&gt;
What we do&lt;br&gt;
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter now&lt;br&gt;
When I was caught&lt;br&gt;
in the rain&lt;br&gt;
You made&lt;br&gt;
me feel&lt;br&gt;
You made me feel&lt;br&gt;
made me feel&lt;br&gt;
I was caught&lt;br&gt;
in the rain&lt;br&gt;
Wasting my time&lt;br&gt;
on the ground&lt;br&gt;
I was caught&lt;br&gt;
in the rain&lt;br&gt;
Wasting my time&lt;br&gt;
on the ground&lt;br&gt;
I was caught&lt;br&gt;
in the rain&lt;br&gt;
Caught&lt;br&gt;
in the rain&lt;/p&gt;
