        &lt;p&gt;There is a rose&lt;br&gt;
in spanish harlem&lt;br&gt;
A red rose up&lt;br&gt;
in spanish harlem&lt;br&gt;
It is a special one&lt;br&gt;
it&amp;rsquo;s never&lt;br&gt;
Seen the sun&lt;br&gt;
it only comes out&lt;br&gt;
When the moon is&lt;br&gt;
on the run&lt;br&gt;
And all the stars&lt;br&gt;
are gleaming&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s growing&lt;br&gt;
in the street&lt;br&gt;
Right up&lt;br&gt;
through the concrete&lt;br&gt;
But soft and sweet&lt;br&gt;
and dreamin&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;
There is a rose&lt;br&gt;
in spanish harlem&lt;br&gt;
A red rose up&lt;br&gt;
in spanish harlem&lt;br&gt;
With eyes as black&lt;br&gt;
as coal&lt;br&gt;
That look down&lt;br&gt;
in my soul&lt;br&gt;
And starts&lt;br&gt;
a fire there&lt;br&gt;
And then&lt;br&gt;
I lose control&lt;br&gt;
I have to&lt;br&gt;
beg your pardon&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m going to&lt;br&gt;
pick that rose and&lt;br&gt;
Watch her as she grows&lt;br&gt;
in my garden-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to&lt;br&gt;
pick that rose&lt;br&gt;
And watch her&lt;br&gt;
as she grows&lt;br&gt;
In my garden&lt;br&gt;
la- la- la-&lt;br&gt;
La- la- la-&lt;br&gt;
la- la- la-&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Oh when the sun&lt;br&gt;
beats down&lt;br&gt;
And burns the tar up&lt;br&gt;
on the roof&lt;br&gt;
And your shoes&lt;br&gt;
get so hot&lt;br&gt;
You wish your tired&lt;br&gt;
feet were fireproof&lt;br&gt;
Under the boardwalk&lt;br&gt;
down by the sea&lt;br&gt;
On a blanket&lt;br&gt;
with my baby&lt;br&gt;
Is where I&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;br&gt;
(under the boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
Out of the sun&lt;br&gt;
(under the boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll be having&lt;br&gt;
some fun&lt;br&gt;
(Under the boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
people walking above&lt;br&gt;
(Under the&lt;br&gt;
boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;br&gt;
falling in love&lt;br&gt;
Under the boardwalk&lt;br&gt;
boardwalk&lt;br&gt;
From the park&lt;br&gt;
you hear&lt;br&gt;
The happy sound&lt;br&gt;
of the carousel&lt;br&gt;
You can almost&lt;br&gt;
taste the hot dogs&lt;br&gt;
And french fries&lt;br&gt;
they sell&lt;br&gt;
Under the boardwalk&lt;br&gt;
down by the sea&lt;br&gt;
On a blanket&lt;br&gt;
with my baby&lt;br&gt;
Is where I&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;br&gt;
(under the boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
Out of the sun&lt;br&gt;
(under the boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll be having&lt;br&gt;
some fun&lt;br&gt;
(Under the boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
people walking above&lt;br&gt;
(Under the&lt;br&gt;
boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;br&gt;
falling in love&lt;br&gt;
Under the boardwalk&lt;br&gt;
boardwalk-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the boardwalk&lt;br&gt;
down by the sea yeah&lt;br&gt;
On a blanket&lt;br&gt;
with my baby&lt;br&gt;
Is where I&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;br&gt;
(under the boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
Out of the sun&lt;br&gt;
(under the boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll be having&lt;br&gt;
some fun&lt;br&gt;
(Under the boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
people walking above&lt;br&gt;
(Under the&lt;br&gt;
boardwalk)&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;br&gt;
falling in love&lt;br&gt;
Under the boardwalk&lt;br&gt;
boardwalk-&lt;/p&gt;
