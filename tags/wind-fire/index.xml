        &lt;p&gt;For awhile to love was&lt;br&gt;
all we could do&lt;br&gt;
We were young&lt;br&gt;
and we knew&lt;br&gt;
And our eyes&lt;br&gt;
were alive&lt;br&gt;
Deep inside we knew&lt;br&gt;
our love was true&lt;br&gt;
For awhile we paid&lt;br&gt;
no mind to the past&lt;br&gt;
We knew&lt;br&gt;
love would last&lt;br&gt;
Every night&lt;br&gt;
somethin&amp;rsquo; right&lt;br&gt;
Would invite us&lt;br&gt;
to begin the dance&lt;br&gt;
Somethin&amp;rsquo; happened&lt;br&gt;
along the way&lt;br&gt;
What used to be&lt;br&gt;
happy was sad&lt;br&gt;
Somethin&amp;rsquo; happened&lt;br&gt;
along the way&lt;br&gt;
And yesterday was&lt;br&gt;
all we had&lt;br&gt;
And oh after&lt;br&gt;
the love has gone&lt;br&gt;
How could you&lt;br&gt;
lead me on&lt;br&gt;
And not let me&lt;br&gt;
stay around&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh oh after&lt;br&gt;
the love has gone&lt;br&gt;
What used to be&lt;br&gt;
right is wrong&lt;br&gt;
Can love that&amp;rsquo;s lost&lt;br&gt;
be found&lt;br&gt;
For awhile&lt;br&gt;
to love each other&lt;br&gt;
With all&lt;br&gt;
we would ever need&lt;br&gt;
Love was strong&lt;br&gt;
for so long&lt;br&gt;
Never knew that&lt;br&gt;
what was wrong&lt;br&gt;
Oh baby&lt;br&gt;
wasn&amp;rsquo;t right&lt;br&gt;
We tried to find&lt;br&gt;
what we had&lt;br&gt;
Till sadness was&lt;br&gt;
all we shared&lt;br&gt;
We were scared&lt;br&gt;
this affair&lt;br&gt;
Would lead&lt;br&gt;
our love into&lt;br&gt;
Somethin&amp;rsquo; happened&lt;br&gt;
along the way&lt;br&gt;
Yesterday was&lt;br&gt;
all we had&lt;br&gt;
Somethin&amp;rsquo; happened&lt;br&gt;
along the way&lt;br&gt;
What used to be&lt;br&gt;
happy is sad&lt;br&gt;
Somethin&amp;rsquo; happened&lt;br&gt;
along the way&lt;br&gt;
Oh yesterday was&lt;br&gt;
all we had&lt;br&gt;
And oh after&lt;br&gt;
the love has gone&lt;br&gt;
How could you&lt;br&gt;
lead me on&lt;br&gt;
And not let me&lt;br&gt;
stay around&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh oh after&lt;br&gt;
the love has gone&lt;br&gt;
What used to be&lt;br&gt;
right is wrong&lt;br&gt;
Can love&lt;br&gt;
that&amp;rsquo;s lost be found&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh&lt;br&gt;
oh oh oh&lt;br&gt;
Oh after the love&lt;br&gt;
has gone&lt;br&gt;
What used to be&lt;br&gt;
right is wrong&lt;br&gt;
Can love that&amp;rsquo;s lost&lt;br&gt;
be found&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh oh after&lt;br&gt;
the love has gone&lt;br&gt;
What used to be&lt;br&gt;
right is wrong&lt;br&gt;
Can love that&amp;rsquo;s lost&lt;br&gt;
be found&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh oh after&lt;br&gt;
the love has gone&lt;br&gt;
What used to be&lt;br&gt;
right is wrong&lt;br&gt;
Can love that&amp;rsquo;s lost&lt;br&gt;
be found oh oh oh&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh oh after&lt;br&gt;
the love has gone&lt;br&gt;
What used to be&lt;br&gt;
right is wrong&lt;br&gt;
Can love that&amp;rsquo;s lost&lt;br&gt;
be found&lt;br&gt;
Oh oh oh after&lt;br&gt;
the love has gone&lt;br&gt;
What used to be&lt;br&gt;
right is wrong&lt;br&gt;
Can love that&amp;rsquo;s lost&lt;br&gt;
be found&lt;/p&gt;
