                Ive been here before But always hit the floor Ive spent a lifetime running And I always get away But with you Im feeling something That makes me want to stay Im prepared for this I never shoot to miss But I feel like a storm is coming If Im gonna make it through the day Then theres no more use in running This is something I gotta face If I risk it all Could you break my fall How do I live how do I breathe When youre not here Im suffocating I want to feel love run through my blood Tell me is this where I give it all up For you I have to risk it all Cause the writings on the wall A million shards of glass That haunt me from my past As the stars begin to gather And the light begins to fade When all hope begins to shatter Know that I wont be afraid If I risk it all Could you break my fall How do I live how do I breathe When youre not here Im suffocating I want to feel love run through my blood Tell me is this where I give it all up For you I have to risk it all Cause the writings on the wall The writings on the wall  How do I live how do I breathe When youre not here Im suffocating I want to feel love run through my blood Tell me is this where I give it all up How do I live how do I breathe When youre not here Im suffocating I want to feel love run through my blood Tell me is this where I give it all up For you I have to risk it all Cause the writings on the wall
