                Standing by my window Breathing summer breeze Saw a figure floating neath the willow tree Asked us if we were happy We said we didnt know Took us by the hands and up we go We followed the dreamer Through the purple hazy clouds He could control our sence of time We thought we were lost But no matter how we tried Everyone was in peace of mind We felt the sensations Drift inside our frames Finding complete contentment there And all the tensions That hurt us in the past Just seemed to vanish in thin air He said in the cosmos Is a single sonic sound That is vibrating constantly And if we could grip And hold on to the note We would see our minds Were free oh theyre free Ah we are lost above floating way up high If you think you can find a way You can surely try  Ah ah ah ah ah
