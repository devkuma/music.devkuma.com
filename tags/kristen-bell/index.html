                Ive seen dark before but not like this This is cold this is empty This is numb The life I knew is over The lights are out Hello darkness Im ready to succumb I follow you around I always have But youve gone to a place I cannot find This grief has a gravity It pulls me down But a tiny voice whispers in my mind You are lost hope is gone But you must go on And do the next right thing Can there be a day beyond this night I dont know anymore what is true I cant find my direction Im all alone The only star that guided me was you How to rise from the floor When its not you Im rising for Just do the next right thing Take a step step again It is all that I can to do The next right thing I wont look too far ahead Its too much for me to take But break it down to this next breath This next step This next choice is one that I can make So Ill walk through this night Stumbling blindly toward the light And do the next right thing And with the dawn what comes then When its clear that everything Will never be the same again Then Ill make the choice To hear that voice And do the next right thing
