                If you search for tenderness It isnt hard to find You can have the love you need to live But if you look for truthfulness You might just as well be blind It always seems to be so hard to give Honesty is such a lonely word Everyone is so untrue Honesty is hardly ever heard And mostly what I need from you I can always find someone To say they sympathize If I wear my heart out on my sleeve But I dont want some pretty face To tell me pretty lies All I want is someone to believe Honesty is such a lonely word Everyone is so untrue Honesty is hardly ever heard And mostly what I need from you I can find a lover I can find a friend I can have security until the bitter end Anyone can comfort me with promises again I know I know I know wo wo When Im deep inside of me Dont be too concerned I wont ask for nothing While Im gone But when I want sincerity Tell me where else can I turn Cause youre the one that I depend upon Honesty is such a lonely word Everyone is so untrue Honesty is hardly ever heard And mostly what I need from you

                Its nine oclock on a Saturday The regular crowd shuffles in Theres an old man sitting next to me Making love to his tonic and gin  He says son can you play me a memory Im not really sure how it goes But its sad and its sweet And I knew it complete When I wore a younger mans Clothes na na na na na Sing us a song youre the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well were all in the mood for a melody And youve got us feeling alright  Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And hes quick with a joke Or to light up your smoke But theres someplace that hed rather be He says Bill I believe this is killing me As the smile ran away from his face Well Im sure that I could be A movie star if I could get out Of this place na na na na na Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And hes talking with Davy Whos still in the navy And probably will be for life  And the waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes theyre sharing a drink They call loneliness But its better than drinking alone  Sing us a song youre the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well were all in the mood for a melody And youve got us feeling alright  Its a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager give me a smile Cause he knows that its me Theyve been coming to see To forget about life for a while And the piano it sounds Like a carnival and the microphone Smells like a beer and they sit at the bar And put bread in my jar And say man what are you doing here Oh na na na na na Sing us a song youre the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well were all in the mood for a melody And youve got us feeling alright

                Well were living here in Allentown And theyre closing all the factories down Out in Bethlehem theyre killing time Filling out forms standing in line Well our fathers fought the Second World War spent their weekends On the Jersey Shore met our mothers In the USO asked them to dance Danced with them slow And were living here in Allentown But the restlessness was handed down And its getting very hard to stay  Well were waiting here in Allentown For the Pennsylvania we never found For the promises our teachers gave If we worked hard if we behaved So the graduations hang on the wall But they never really helped us at all No they never taught us what was real Iron and coke and chromium steel And were waiting here in Allentown But theyve taken all the coal From the ground and the union people Crawled away  Every child had a pretty Good shot to get at least As far as their old man got But something happened On the way to that place They threw an American flag in our face  Well Im living here in Allentown And its hard to keep a good man down But I wont be getting up today  And its getting very hard to stay And were living here in Allentown
