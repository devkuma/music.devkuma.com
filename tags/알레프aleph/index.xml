&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirrors&lt;br&gt;
They are all around&lt;br&gt;
Dreamers&lt;br&gt;
Why do they disappear&lt;br&gt;
Does real life drags you from this fantasy world&lt;br&gt;
Callings you missed many times&lt;br&gt;
Surely they wouldn’t helped at all&lt;br&gt;
You began to realize&lt;br&gt;
There is a missing part in you&lt;br&gt;
Oh said I many times many times&lt;br&gt;
You will be wandering&lt;br&gt;
Despite everything you have been through&lt;br&gt;
Oh said I many times many times&lt;br&gt;
Can you see the world&lt;br&gt;
It is turning up side down&lt;br&gt;
Can you see it clear&lt;br&gt;
Can you feel it now&lt;br&gt;
still mesmerized by&lt;br&gt;
Dreamer’s solitude&lt;br&gt;
Mirrors fall like dominoes&lt;br&gt;
Break into pieces&lt;br&gt;
No clue&lt;br&gt;
No whatsoever&lt;br&gt;
For the life of you&lt;br&gt;
Oh said I many times many times&lt;br&gt;
You will be wandering&lt;br&gt;
Despite everything you have been through&lt;br&gt;
Oh said I many times many times&lt;br&gt;
Can you see the world&lt;br&gt;
It is turning up side down&lt;br&gt;
What now&lt;br&gt;
This world is a mystery&lt;br&gt;
You should wake&lt;br&gt;
Before the kingdom falls down&lt;br&gt;
Right now&lt;br&gt;
What you doing now&lt;br&gt;
It is meaningless trying in your dream&lt;br&gt;
Oh said I many times many times&lt;br&gt;
You will be wandering&lt;br&gt;
Despite everything you have been through&lt;br&gt;
Oh said I many times too many times&lt;br&gt;
Can you see the world&lt;br&gt;
You are turning up side down&lt;br&gt;
You dream a little dream&lt;br&gt;
Dream a little dream&lt;br&gt;
You dream a little dream&lt;br&gt;
Dream a little dream&lt;br&gt;
Tonight&lt;/p&gt;
