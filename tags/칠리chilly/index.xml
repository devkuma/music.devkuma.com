&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did you feel the first day you saw me?&lt;br&gt;
Maybe you remember everything&lt;br&gt;
About that day&lt;br&gt;
And you can still smell the scent of that time&lt;br&gt;
How did you feel the first day you saw me?&lt;br&gt;
Maybe you remember everything&lt;br&gt;
About that day&lt;br&gt;
And you can still smell the scent of that time&lt;br&gt;
You drew my starting line in &amp;lsquo;92&lt;br&gt;
And I drew a hideous line on your body too&lt;br&gt;
How painful the scar&lt;br&gt;
Must have been every every night&lt;br&gt;
And then you tried to stop the time&lt;br&gt;
That changed me day by day&lt;br&gt;
But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep your most beautiful days&lt;br&gt;
My beginning was not special at all&lt;br&gt;
I fought a lot with my bro in a small house&lt;br&gt;
And I cried whenever I had time&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s how I tore your heart&lt;br&gt;
What you always said to me&lt;br&gt;
You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be rich&lt;br&gt;
But your mind should be rich&lt;br&gt;
That brought me all this way&lt;br&gt;
And saved me many times&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m gonna live with that word&lt;br&gt;
In my head remembering you&lt;br&gt;
How did you feel the first day you saw me?&lt;br&gt;
Maybe you remember everything&lt;br&gt;
About that day&lt;br&gt;
And you can still smell the scent of that time&lt;br&gt;
How did you feel the first day you saw me?&lt;br&gt;
Maybe you remember everything&lt;br&gt;
About that day&lt;br&gt;
And you can still smell the scent of that time&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m becoming you before I know it&lt;br&gt;
But unlike you I still feel like a child&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll never be like you&lt;br&gt;
I really want to tell you&lt;br&gt;
If I could live another life&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d like to start over with you&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m becoming you before I know it&lt;br&gt;
But unlike you I still feel like a child&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll never be like you&lt;br&gt;
I really want to tell you&lt;br&gt;
If I could live another life&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d like to start over with you&lt;/p&gt;
