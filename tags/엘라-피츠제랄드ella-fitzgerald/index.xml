&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heaven I&amp;rsquo;m in heaven&lt;br&gt;
And my heart beats so that&lt;br&gt;
I can hardly speak&lt;br&gt;
And I seem to find the happiness I seek&lt;br&gt;
When we&amp;rsquo;re out together&lt;br&gt;
Dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Yes heaven I&amp;rsquo;m in heaven&lt;br&gt;
And the cares that hung&lt;br&gt;
Around me through the week&lt;br&gt;
Seem to vanish like a gambler&amp;rsquo;s lucky streak&lt;br&gt;
When we&amp;rsquo;re out together&lt;br&gt;
Dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Oh I&amp;rsquo;d love to climb a mountain&lt;br&gt;
And reach the highest peak&lt;br&gt;
But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t thrill me half as much&lt;br&gt;
As dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Oh I&amp;rsquo;d love to go out fishing&lt;br&gt;
In a river or a creek&lt;br&gt;
But I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it half as much&lt;br&gt;
As dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Now mama dance with me&lt;br&gt;
I want my arms about you&lt;br&gt;
The charms about you&lt;br&gt;
Will carry me through yes&lt;br&gt;
Heaven I&amp;rsquo;m in heaven&lt;br&gt;
And my heart beats so that&lt;br&gt;
I can hardly speak&lt;br&gt;
And I seem to find the happiness I seek&lt;br&gt;
When we&amp;rsquo;re out together&lt;br&gt;
Dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
(Sing it ella swing it)&lt;br&gt;
Heaven I&amp;rsquo;m in heaven&lt;br&gt;
And my heart beats so that&lt;br&gt;
I can hardly speak&lt;br&gt;
And I seem to find the happiness I seek&lt;br&gt;
When we&amp;rsquo;re out together&lt;br&gt;
Dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Heaven I&amp;rsquo;m in heaven&lt;br&gt;
And the cares that hung&lt;br&gt;
Around me through the week&lt;br&gt;
Seem to vanish like a gambler&amp;rsquo;s lucky streak&lt;br&gt;
When we&amp;rsquo;re out together&lt;br&gt;
Dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Oh I&amp;rsquo;d love to climb a mountain&lt;br&gt;
And reach the highest peak&lt;br&gt;
But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t thrill me half as much&lt;br&gt;
As dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Oh I love to go out fishing&lt;br&gt;
In a river or a creek&lt;br&gt;
But I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it half as much&lt;br&gt;
As dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Come on and dance with me&lt;br&gt;
I want my arm about you&lt;br&gt;
The charm about you&lt;br&gt;
Will carry me through to&lt;br&gt;
Heaven I&amp;rsquo;m in heaven&lt;br&gt;
And my heart beats so that&lt;br&gt;
I can hardly speak&lt;br&gt;
And I seem to find the happiness I seek&lt;br&gt;
When we&amp;rsquo;re out together&lt;br&gt;
Dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Yes dance with me&lt;br&gt;
I want my arm about you&lt;br&gt;
The charm about you&lt;br&gt;
Will carry me through to&lt;br&gt;
Heaven I&amp;rsquo;m in heaven&lt;br&gt;
And my heart beats so that&lt;br&gt;
I can hardly speak&lt;br&gt;
And I seem to find the happiness I seek&lt;br&gt;
When we&amp;rsquo;re out together&lt;br&gt;
Dancing cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Cheek to cheek&lt;br&gt;
Cheek to cheek&lt;/p&gt;
