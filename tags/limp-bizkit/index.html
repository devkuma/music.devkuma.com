                No one knows what its like to be the bad man To be the sad man behind blue eyes And no one knows what its like to be hated To be faded to telling only lies But my dreams they arent as empty As my conscious seems to be i have hours Only lonely my love is vengeance Thats never free no one knows what Its like to feel these feelings Like i do and i blame you No one bites back as hard on their anger None of my pain woe can show through But my dreams they arent as empty As my conscious seems to be i have hours Only lonely my love is vengeance Thats never free discover l i m p say It discover l i m p say it discover L i m p say it discover l i m p Say it discover no one knows what Its like to be mistreated to Be defeated behind blue eyes No one knows how to say that Theyre sorry and dont worry Im not telling lies but my dreams They arent as empty as my conscious Seems to be i have hours only Lonely my love is vengeance Thats never free no one knows What its like to be the bad man To be the sad man behind blue eyes
