                She was more like a beauty queen From a movie scene I said dont mind but what do you mean I am the one Who will dance on the floor in the round She said I am the one Who will dance on the floor in the round She told me her name was Billie Jean As she caused a scene Then every head turned with eyes That dreamed of being the one Who will dance on the floor in the round People always told me Be careful of what you do And dont go around breaking Young girls hearts And mother always told me Be careful of who you love And be careful of what you do Cause the lie becomes the truth Billie Jean is not my lover Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one But the kid is not my son For forty days and forty nights The law was on her side But who can stand when shes in demand Her schemes and plans Cause we danced on the floor in the round So take my strong advice Just remember to always think twice People always told me Be careful of what you do And dont go around Breaking young girls hearts And mother always told me Be careful of who you love And be careful of what you do Cause the lie becomes the truth Billie Jean is not my lover Shes just a girl who claims That I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one But the kid is not my son
