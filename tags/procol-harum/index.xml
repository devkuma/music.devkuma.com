        &lt;p&gt;We skipped&lt;br&gt;
the light fandango&lt;br&gt;
And turned cartwheels&lt;br&gt;
cross the floor&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;
I was feeling&lt;br&gt;
kind of seasick&lt;br&gt;
But the crowd&lt;br&gt;
called out for more&lt;br&gt;
The room was&lt;br&gt;
humming harder-&lt;br&gt;
And the ceiling&lt;br&gt;
flew away-&lt;br&gt;
When we called out&lt;br&gt;
for another drink&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;
The waiter brought&lt;br&gt;
a tray-&lt;br&gt;
As so it was&lt;br&gt;
that later&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;
As the miller&lt;br&gt;
told his tale&lt;br&gt;
That her face&lt;br&gt;
at first just ghostly&lt;br&gt;
Turned a whiter&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;
shade of pale&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said&lt;br&gt;
there is no reason-&lt;br&gt;
And the truth is&lt;br&gt;
plain to see-&lt;br&gt;
But I wondered through&lt;br&gt;
my playing cards&lt;br&gt;
And would not&lt;br&gt;
let her be&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
One of sixteen&lt;br&gt;
vestal virgins&lt;br&gt;
Who were leaving&lt;br&gt;
for the coast&lt;br&gt;
And although&lt;br&gt;
my eyes&amp;ndash; open&lt;br&gt;
They might just&lt;br&gt;
have well been closed&lt;br&gt;
And so it was-&lt;br&gt;
that later&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
As the miller told&lt;br&gt;
his tale&lt;br&gt;
That her face at first&lt;br&gt;
just ghostly&lt;br&gt;
Turned a whiter&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;
shade of pale&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
