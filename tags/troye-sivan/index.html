                Remember when we first met You said light my cigarette So I lied to my mom and dad And jumped the fence and I ran But we couldnt go very far Cause you locked your keys in your car So you sat and stared at my lips And I could already feel your kiss Long nights daydreams sugar and smoke rings Ive been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like you Headlights on me racing to 60 Ive been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like Blue eyes black jeans lighters and candy Ive been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like you Remember when you taught me fate Said it all be worth the wait Like that night in the back of the cab When your fingers walked in my hand Next day nothing on my phone But I can still smell you on my clothes Always hoping things would change But we went right back to your games Long nights daydreams sugar and smoke rings Ive been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like you Headlights on me racing to 60 Ive been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like Blue eyes black jeans lighters and candy Ive been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like you And even if I run away And give my heart a holiday Still strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like you You always leave me wanting more I cant shake my hunger for Strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like you Yeah they always taste like you you Long nights daydreams With that sugar and smoke rings Always taste like you Headlights on me racing to 60 Ive been a fool Strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like Blue eyes black jeans lighters and candy Ive been a fool Strawberries and cigarettes Always taste like you
