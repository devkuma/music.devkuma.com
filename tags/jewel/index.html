                You took your coat off stood in the rain You were always crazy like that And I watched from my window Always felt I was outside Looking in on you You were always the mysterious one With dark eyes and careless hair You were fashionably sensitive But too cool to care then you stood In my doorway with nothing to say Besides some comment on the weather Well in case you failed to notice In case you failed to see This is my heart bleeding before you This is me down on my knees These foolish games are tearing me Apart your thoughtless words Are breaking my heart Youre breaking my heart  You were always brilliant In the morning smoking Your cigarettes talking over coffee Your philosophies on art Baroque moved you you loved Mozart And youd speak of your loved ones As I clumsily strummed my guitar Youd teach me of honest things Things that were daring Things that were clean things that knew What an honest dollar did mean so I hid my soiled hands behind my back Somewhere along the line I must have gone off track with you Excuse me think Ive mistaken You for somebody else Somebody who gave a damn Somebody more like myself These foolish games are tearing me You tearing me you tearing me apart And Your thoughtless Words are breaking my heart Youre breaking my heart  You took your coat off and stood in the rain You were always crazy like that
