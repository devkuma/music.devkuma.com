                When youre drowning when youre freezing When youre feeling cold There is a light in the darkness As the elder always told When the Winter is coming closer And the Autumn is passing by And the world will sink in silence And I think we all should try Oh I wanna live my life in a fairy tale Where the end is always good and Never sad show me the way To another world where the sun is always Shining in the end and we fight Back the tears and we lose our fears Let the world remain in silence For a while sun in our minds In a world full of ice let the silence Remain for a little while Somebody came and slammed the door Took the feeling away from our hearts And the horror took hold of a place In our hearts filled with love What is left behind the ice Behind the make up and the lies Tell me what goes on inside our minds There is a hole in our sky Getting bigger growing wide No more answer but we hold the line Uh yeah see and hear what We have done to us all we wanna be free More than anything do you hear What I say to you we will make it Through the sun shall shine  Hear the words we say and see the light Of day we never will be free Until the sun is shining for us all Carry on carry on and make our dreams Come true and for a little while We stay together carry on carry on May all our loving stay And for a little while we stay together Forever together forever Together forever together forever

                Coming out of misery Back to the old energy Taking part in our daily show Think of what has been Before made a move and Slammed the door future will remain In the unknown face the face Of the race try to understand Why are we here and what is beyond The wheel of our life that is Spinning around loud and proud Were gonna say it now live life easy Live life easy what is good and What is fair problems solved But I dont care sometimes its just Getting out of hand tell me where Tell me when will I understand Why are we here and what is beyond The wheel of our life That is turning around Loud and proud Were gonna say it now Live life easy live life easy  Oh let us fly away Let us praise the days When the lust for life is stronger Than a fear though we shilver and shake And we sometimes need a break Its the lust for life that Never disappears loud and proud Were gonna say it now live life easy Live life easy live life easy
