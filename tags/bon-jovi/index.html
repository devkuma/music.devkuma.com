                Hey man its been a while Do you remember me When I hit the streets I was 17 A little wild a little green Been up and down and in between After all these years miles and memories Im still chasing dreams But I aint looking over my shoulder I like the bed Im sleeping in And just like me its broken in Its not old just older Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans The skin Im in its alright with me Its not old just older Its good to see your face You aint no worse for wear Breathing that californian air When we took on the world We were young and brave We got secrets that well take to the grave Standing here shoulder to shoulder I like the bed Im sleeping in And just like me its broken in Its not old just older Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans The skin Im in its alright with me Its not old just older Im not old enough to sing the blues But I wore the holes In the soles of these shoes You can roll the dice Til they call your bluff But you cant win Until youre not afraid to loose yeah  When I look in the mirror I dont hate what I see Theres a few more lines Staring back at me now the night Has grown a little bit colder Hey man I gotta run now you take care If you see coach T Tell him Ive cut my hair But I keep my faith I still believe Im just ha I like the bed Im sleeping in And just like me its broken in Its not old just older Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans The skin Im in its alright with me Its not old just older ah ah yeah Its not old just
