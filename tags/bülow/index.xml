&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 2 3 4&lt;br&gt;
Two punks in love&lt;br&gt;
You had my back from day one&lt;br&gt;
We were so young&lt;br&gt;
Yeah that stuff hit like a truck&lt;br&gt;
A loaded gun&lt;br&gt;
That cupid knew what was up&lt;br&gt;
And now I&amp;rsquo;m locked&lt;br&gt;
Inseparable we&amp;rsquo;ve become&lt;br&gt;
Even though the years go by&lt;br&gt;
Seasons changed and flowers died&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re still rocking side by side&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m still yours and you&amp;rsquo;re still mine&lt;br&gt;
You broke my heart a million times&lt;br&gt;
Can&amp;rsquo;t count the ways I&amp;rsquo;ve made you cry&lt;br&gt;
Oh we&amp;rsquo;re such a mess&lt;br&gt;
But I get depressed&lt;br&gt;
At the thought of losing you&lt;br&gt;
We were kids it&amp;rsquo;s been a while&lt;br&gt;
But you still work to make me smile&lt;br&gt;
A stolen kiss now I can&amp;rsquo;t wait&lt;br&gt;
To waste my life away with you&lt;br&gt;
You waste my life away with you you&lt;br&gt;
Two punks in love&lt;br&gt;
Growing pains from growing up&lt;br&gt;
Your dad was drunk&lt;br&gt;
Your escape was my house&lt;br&gt;
Yours fell apart&lt;br&gt;
They said their love was not enough&lt;br&gt;
But from the start&lt;br&gt;
We promise we won&amp;rsquo;t give up&lt;br&gt;
Even though the years go by&lt;br&gt;
Seasons changed and flowers died&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re still rocking side by side&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m still yours and you&amp;rsquo;re still mine&lt;br&gt;
You broke my heart a million times&lt;br&gt;
Can&amp;rsquo;t count the ways I&amp;rsquo;ve made you cry&lt;br&gt;
Oh we&amp;rsquo;re such a mess&lt;br&gt;
But I get depressed&lt;br&gt;
At the thought of losing you&lt;br&gt;
We were kids it&amp;rsquo;s been a while&lt;br&gt;
But you still work to make me smile&lt;br&gt;
A stolen kiss now I can&amp;rsquo;t wait&lt;br&gt;
To waste my life away with you&lt;br&gt;
You(With you with you)&lt;br&gt;
Waste my life away with you you&lt;br&gt;
(With you with you)&lt;br&gt;
Two punks in love&lt;br&gt;
Burning up so pretty low&lt;br&gt;
Not giving up not giving up not giving up&lt;br&gt;
Two punks in love(Yeah yeah)&lt;br&gt;
Burning up so pretty low&lt;br&gt;
Not giving up not giving up not giving up&lt;br&gt;
You broke my heart a million times&lt;br&gt;
Can&amp;rsquo;t count the ways I&amp;rsquo;ve made you cry&lt;br&gt;
Oh we&amp;rsquo;re such a mess&lt;br&gt;
But I get depressed&lt;br&gt;
At the thought of losing you&lt;br&gt;
We were kids it&amp;rsquo;s been a while&lt;br&gt;
But you still work to make me smile&lt;br&gt;
A stolen kiss now I can&amp;rsquo;t wait&lt;br&gt;
To waste my life away with you&lt;br&gt;
You(With you with you)&lt;br&gt;
Waste my life away with you you&lt;br&gt;
(With you with you)&lt;br&gt;
You waste my life away with you you&lt;/p&gt;
