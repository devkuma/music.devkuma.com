                Maybe no one told you There is strength in your tears And so you fight to keep from pouring out But what if you unlock the gate that Keeps your secret soul do you think That theres enough you might drown If no one will listen if you decide to speak If no one is left standing After the bombs explode If no one wants to look at you For what you really are I will be here still No one can tell you Where you alone must go Theres no telling What you will find there And God I know the fear that Eats away at your bones Its screaming every step Just stay here If no one will listen if you decide to speak If no one is left standing After the bombs explode If no one wants to look at you For what you really are I will be here still  If you find your fists are raw and red From beating yourself down If your legs have given out Under the weight if you find Youve been settling for a world of gray So you wouldnt have to face down Your own hate If no one will listen if you decide to speak If no one is left standing After the bombs explode If no one wants to look at you For what you really are I will be here still If no one will listen if you decide to speak If no one is left standing After the bombs explode If no one wants to look at you For what you really are I will be here still I will be here still
