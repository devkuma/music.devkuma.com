        &lt;p&gt;She came from Greece&lt;br&gt;
she had a thirst&lt;br&gt;
for knowledge&lt;br&gt;
She studied&lt;br&gt;
sculpture at&lt;br&gt;
Saint Martins&lt;br&gt;
College That&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
where I caught&lt;br&gt;
her eye&lt;br&gt;
She told me that&lt;br&gt;
her dad&lt;br&gt;
was loaded&lt;br&gt;
I said In that&lt;br&gt;
case I&amp;rsquo;ll have&lt;br&gt;
a rum&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; coca-cola&lt;br&gt;
She said Fine &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
in 30 seconds&lt;br&gt;
time she said&lt;br&gt;
I want to live like&lt;br&gt;
common people I&lt;br&gt;
want to do whatever&lt;br&gt;
common people do&lt;br&gt;
I want to sleep with&lt;br&gt;
common people&lt;br&gt;
I want to sleep with&lt;br&gt;
common people&lt;br&gt;
like you&lt;br&gt;
Well what else&lt;br&gt;
could I do? I said&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll see what&lt;br&gt;
I can do&lt;br&gt;
I took her to a&lt;br&gt;
supermarket&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why&lt;br&gt;
but I had to&lt;br&gt;
start it&lt;br&gt;
somewhere So it&lt;br&gt;
started there&lt;br&gt;
I said Pretend&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;ve got&lt;br&gt;
no money&lt;br&gt;
But she just&lt;br&gt;
laughed &amp;amp; said Oh&lt;br&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;re so funny&lt;br&gt;
I said Yeah?&lt;br&gt;
Well I can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
see anyone&lt;br&gt;
else smiling&lt;br&gt;
in here&lt;br&gt;
Are you sure you&lt;br&gt;
want to live like&lt;br&gt;
common people?&lt;br&gt;
You want to see&lt;br&gt;
whatever common&lt;br&gt;
people see&lt;br&gt;
You want to sleep&lt;br&gt;
with common people&lt;br&gt;
You want to sleep&lt;br&gt;
with common people&lt;br&gt;
like me?&lt;br&gt;
But she didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
understand&lt;br&gt;
she just&lt;br&gt;
smiled &amp;amp; held&lt;br&gt;
my hand&lt;br&gt;
Rent a flat above a&lt;br&gt;
shop Cut your hair&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; get a job&lt;br&gt;
Smoke some fags&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; play&lt;br&gt;
some pool&lt;br&gt;
Pretend you never&lt;br&gt;
went to school&lt;br&gt;
But still you&amp;rsquo;ll&lt;br&gt;
never get it right&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;cos when you&amp;rsquo;re&lt;br&gt;
laid in bed&lt;br&gt;
At night watching&lt;br&gt;
roaches climb&lt;br&gt;
the wall&lt;br&gt;
If you called your&lt;br&gt;
dad he could&lt;br&gt;
stop it all&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll never live&lt;br&gt;
like common people&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll never do&lt;br&gt;
whatever common&lt;br&gt;
people do&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll never fail&lt;br&gt;
like common people&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll never watch&lt;br&gt;
your life slide&lt;br&gt;
out of view&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; dance &amp;amp; drink&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; screw Because&lt;br&gt;
there&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
nothing else to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing along with the&lt;br&gt;
common people&lt;br&gt;
Sing along &amp;amp; it&lt;br&gt;
might just get yhou&lt;br&gt;
through&lt;br&gt;
Laugh along&lt;br&gt;
with the&lt;br&gt;
common people&lt;br&gt;
Laugh along even&lt;br&gt;
though they&amp;rsquo;re&lt;br&gt;
laughing at you&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; the stupid&lt;br&gt;
Things that you do&lt;br&gt;
because you think&lt;br&gt;
that poor is cool&lt;br&gt;
Like a dog lying&lt;br&gt;
in a corner they&lt;br&gt;
will bite you&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; never warn you&lt;br&gt;
Look out they&amp;rsquo;ll&lt;br&gt;
tear your&lt;br&gt;
insides out&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cos everybody&lt;br&gt;
hates a tourist&lt;br&gt;
Especially one&lt;br&gt;
who thinks it&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
all such a laugh&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; the chip&lt;br&gt;
Stains &amp;amp; grease&lt;br&gt;
will come out&lt;br&gt;
in the bath&lt;br&gt;
You will never&lt;br&gt;
understand how it&lt;br&gt;
feels to live your&lt;br&gt;
life with no&lt;br&gt;
Meaning or control&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; with nowhere&lt;br&gt;
left to go&lt;br&gt;
You are amazed that&lt;br&gt;
they exist &amp;amp; they&lt;br&gt;
burn so bright&lt;br&gt;
whilst You can only&lt;br&gt;
wonder why&lt;br&gt;
Rent a flat above&lt;br&gt;
a shop Cut your hair&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; get a job&lt;br&gt;
Smoke some fags&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; play some pool&lt;br&gt;
Pretend you never&lt;br&gt;
went to school&lt;br&gt;
But still you&amp;rsquo;ll&lt;br&gt;
