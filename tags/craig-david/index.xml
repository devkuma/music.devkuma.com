        &lt;p&gt;On my way&lt;br&gt;
to see my friends&lt;br&gt;
Who lived a couple&lt;br&gt;
blocks away from me&lt;br&gt;
As I walked&lt;br&gt;
through the subway&lt;br&gt;
It must&lt;br&gt;
have been about&lt;br&gt;
quarter past three&lt;br&gt;
in front of me&lt;br&gt;
Stood&lt;br&gt;
a beautiful&lt;br&gt;
honey with&lt;br&gt;
a beautiful body&lt;br&gt;
She asked me&lt;br&gt;
for the time&lt;br&gt;
I said it&amp;rsquo;d cost&lt;br&gt;
her name&lt;br&gt;
A six digit number&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; a date with me&lt;br&gt;
Tomorrow at nine&lt;br&gt;
did she decline? No&lt;br&gt;
Didn&amp;rsquo;t she mind&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t think so&lt;br&gt;
Was it for real&lt;br&gt;
damn sure&lt;br&gt;
What was the deal&lt;br&gt;
a pretty girl aged 24&lt;br&gt;
So was she keen&lt;br&gt;
she couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait&lt;br&gt;
Cinnamon queen&lt;br&gt;
let me update&lt;br&gt;
What did she say&lt;br&gt;
she said she&amp;rsquo;d love to&lt;br&gt;
Rendezvous&lt;br&gt;
She asked me&lt;br&gt;
What we were gonna do&lt;br&gt;
said we&amp;rsquo;d start with&lt;br&gt;
A bottle of moet&lt;br&gt;
for two Monday&lt;br&gt;
Took her for&lt;br&gt;
a drink on Tuesday&lt;br&gt;
We were making&lt;br&gt;
love by Wednesday&lt;br&gt;
And on Thursday&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; Friday &amp;amp; Saturday&lt;br&gt;
We chilled&lt;br&gt;
on Sunday&lt;br&gt;
I met this girl&lt;br&gt;
on Monday&lt;br&gt;
Took her for a drink&lt;br&gt;
on Tuesday&lt;br&gt;
We were making love&lt;br&gt;
by Wednesday&lt;br&gt;
And on Thursday&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; Friday &amp;amp; Saturday&lt;br&gt;
We chilled on Sunday&lt;br&gt;
nine was the time&lt;br&gt;
Cos I&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;br&gt;
getting mine&lt;br&gt;
And she was&lt;br&gt;
looking fine&lt;br&gt;
Smooth talker&lt;br&gt;
She told me&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;d love to unfold&lt;br&gt;
me all night long&lt;br&gt;
Ooh I loved the way&lt;br&gt;
she kicked it&lt;br&gt;
From the front to back&lt;br&gt;
she flipped it&lt;br&gt;
And I oh I yeah&lt;br&gt;
hope that she&amp;rsquo;d care&lt;br&gt;
Cos I&amp;rsquo;m a man who&amp;rsquo;ll&lt;br&gt;
always be there&lt;br&gt;
Ooh yeah&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not a man&lt;br&gt;
To play around baby&lt;br&gt;
ooh yeah&lt;br&gt;
Cos a one night stand&lt;br&gt;
isn&amp;rsquo;t really fair&lt;br&gt;
From the first&lt;br&gt;
impression girl&lt;br&gt;
You don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
seem to be like that&lt;br&gt;
Cos there&amp;rsquo;s no need&lt;br&gt;
to chat for&lt;br&gt;
There&amp;rsquo;ll be plenty&lt;br&gt;
for that&lt;br&gt;
From the subway&lt;br&gt;
to my home&lt;br&gt;
Endless ringing of&lt;br&gt;
my phone&lt;br&gt;
When you feeling&lt;br&gt;
all alone&lt;br&gt;
All you gotta do&lt;br&gt;
is just&lt;br&gt;
Call me call me&lt;br&gt;
Monday&lt;br&gt;
Took her for a drink&lt;br&gt;
on Tuesday&lt;br&gt;
We were making love&lt;br&gt;
by Wednesday&lt;br&gt;
And on Thursday&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; Friday &amp;amp; Saturday&lt;br&gt;
We chilled&lt;br&gt;
on Sunday&lt;br&gt;
I met this girl&lt;br&gt;
on Monday&lt;br&gt;
Took her for a drink&lt;br&gt;
on Tuesday&lt;br&gt;
We were making love&lt;br&gt;
by Wednesday&lt;br&gt;
And on Thursday&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; Friday &amp;amp; Saturday&lt;br&gt;
We chilled&lt;br&gt;
on Sunday&lt;br&gt;
Since I met&lt;br&gt;
this special lady&lt;br&gt;
ooh yeah&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t get her&lt;br&gt;
Of my mind&lt;br&gt;
she&amp;rsquo;s one of a kind&lt;br&gt;
And I ain&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
about to deny it&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a special&lt;br&gt;
kind of thing&lt;br&gt;
With you oh&lt;br&gt;
Monday&lt;br&gt;
Took her for a drink&lt;br&gt;
on Tuesday&lt;br&gt;
We were making love&lt;br&gt;
by Wednesday&lt;br&gt;
And on Thursday&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; Friday &amp;amp; Saturday&lt;br&gt;
We chilled&lt;br&gt;
on Sunday&lt;br&gt;
I met this girl&lt;br&gt;
on Monday&lt;br&gt;
Took her for a drink&lt;br&gt;
on Tuesday&lt;br&gt;
We were making love&lt;br&gt;
by Wednesday&lt;br&gt;
And on Thursday&lt;br&gt;
&amp;amp; Friday &amp;amp; Saturday&lt;br&gt;
We chilled&lt;br&gt;
on Sunday-&lt;/p&gt;
