                No New Years Day to celebrate no choclate covered candy hearts to give away No first of spring no song to sing In fact heres just another ordinary day No April rain no flowers bloom no wedding Saturday within the month of June But what it is is something true made up of these three words that I must say to you I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart No summers high no warm July no harvest moon to light one tender August night No autumn breeze no falling leaves Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies No Libra sun no Halloween no giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring But what it is though old so new To fill your heart like no three words could ever do I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart I just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care I just called to say I love you And I mean it from the bottom of my heart of my heart baby of my heart

                You know it doesnt make much sense There ought to be a law against Anyone who takes offense At a day in your celebration Cause we all know in our minds That there ought to be a time That we can set aside to show Just how much we love you And Im sure you would agree It couldnt fit more perfectly Than to have a world party On the day you came to be Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you Happy birthday happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you happy birthday I just never understood How a man who died for good Could not have a day that would Be set aside for his recognition Because it should never be Just because some cannot see The dream as clear as he That they should make it become an illusion And we all know everything That he stood for time will bring For in peace our hearts will sing Thanks to Martin Luther King Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you Happy birthday happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you happy birthday Why has there never been a holiday yeah Where peace is celebrated All throughout the world The time is overdue For people like me and you Who know the way to truth Is love and unity to all Gods children It should never be a great event And the whole day should be spent In full remembrance of those Who lived and died for the oneness Of all people so let us all begin We know that love can win Let it out dont hold it in Sing it loud as you can Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you Happy birthday happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you happy birthday Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you happy birthday Happy birthday happy birthday Woo yeah happy birthday Happy birthday happy birthday Happy birthday happy birthday Happy birthday happy birthday Happy birthday happy birthday Happy birthday happy birthday
