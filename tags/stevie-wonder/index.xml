        &lt;p&gt;작곡: Sung by / 작사: Stevie Wonder&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=61634&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;61634&lt;/a&gt; / TJ: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@TJKaraoke/search?query=21158&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;21158&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been building&lt;br&gt;
My castle of love&lt;br&gt;
just for two&lt;br&gt;
Though you never knew&lt;br&gt;
you were my reason&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve gone much too far&lt;br&gt;
for you now to say&lt;br&gt;
That I&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;br&gt;
got to throw&lt;br&gt;
My castle away&lt;br&gt;
over dreams&lt;br&gt;
I have picked out a&lt;br&gt;
perfect come true&lt;br&gt;
Though you never knew&lt;br&gt;
it was of you&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been dreaming&lt;br&gt;
the sandman has come&lt;br&gt;
From too far away&lt;br&gt;
for you to say&lt;br&gt;
Come back&lt;br&gt;
some other day&lt;br&gt;
And though you don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
believe that they do&lt;br&gt;
They do come true&lt;br&gt;
for did my dreams&lt;br&gt;
Come true&lt;br&gt;
when I looked at you&lt;br&gt;
And maybe too&lt;br&gt;
if you would believe&lt;br&gt;
You too might be&lt;br&gt;
overjoyed&lt;br&gt;
Over loved&lt;br&gt;
over me&lt;br&gt;
Over hearts&lt;br&gt;
I have painfully&lt;br&gt;
Turned every stone&lt;br&gt;
just to find&lt;br&gt;
I had found&lt;br&gt;
what I&amp;rsquo;ve searched&lt;br&gt;
To discover&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve come much too far&lt;br&gt;
For me now to find&lt;br&gt;
the love that&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve sought&lt;br&gt;
can never be mine&lt;br&gt;
And though you don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
believe that they do&lt;br&gt;
They do come true&lt;br&gt;
for did my dreams&lt;br&gt;
Come true&lt;br&gt;
when I looked at you&lt;br&gt;
And maybe too&lt;br&gt;
if you would believe&lt;br&gt;
You too might be&lt;br&gt;
overjoyed&lt;br&gt;
Over loved&lt;br&gt;
over me&lt;br&gt;
And though the odds&lt;br&gt;
say improbable&lt;br&gt;
What do they know&lt;br&gt;
for in romance&lt;br&gt;
All true love&lt;br&gt;
needs is a chance&lt;br&gt;
And maybe with a&lt;br&gt;
chance you will find&lt;br&gt;
You too like I&lt;br&gt;
overjoyed&lt;br&gt;
Over loved over you&lt;br&gt;
over you&lt;/p&gt;

KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=8443&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;8443&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know it doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br&gt;
make much sense&lt;br&gt;
There ought to be&lt;br&gt;
a law against&lt;br&gt;
Anyone who&lt;br&gt;
takes offense&lt;br&gt;
At a day&lt;br&gt;
in your celebration&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Cause we all know&lt;br&gt;
in our minds&lt;br&gt;
That there ought&lt;br&gt;
to be a time&lt;br&gt;
That we can set aside&lt;br&gt;
to show&lt;br&gt;
Just how much&lt;br&gt;
we love you&lt;br&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;m sure&lt;br&gt;
you would agree&lt;br&gt;
It couldn&amp;rsquo;t fit&lt;br&gt;
more perfectly&lt;br&gt;
Than to have&lt;br&gt;
a world party&lt;br&gt;
On the day&lt;br&gt;
you came to be&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
I just&lt;br&gt;
never understood&lt;br&gt;
How a man who died&lt;br&gt;
for good&lt;br&gt;
Could not have&lt;br&gt;
a day that would&lt;br&gt;
Be set aside&lt;br&gt;
for his recognition&lt;br&gt;
Because it should&lt;br&gt;
never be&lt;br&gt;
Just because&lt;br&gt;
some cannot see&lt;br&gt;
The dream&lt;br&gt;
as clear as he&lt;br&gt;
That they should make&lt;br&gt;
it become an illusion&lt;br&gt;
And we all&lt;br&gt;
know everything&lt;br&gt;
That he stood for time&lt;br&gt;
will bring&lt;br&gt;
For in peace&lt;br&gt;
our hearts will sing&lt;br&gt;
Thanks to&lt;br&gt;
Martin Luther King&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
Why has there never&lt;br&gt;
been a holiday yeah&lt;br&gt;
Where peace&lt;br&gt;
is celebrated&lt;br&gt;
All throughout&lt;br&gt;
the world&lt;br&gt;
The time&lt;br&gt;
is overdue&lt;br&gt;
For people&lt;br&gt;
like me and you&lt;br&gt;
Who know the way&lt;br&gt;
to truth&lt;br&gt;
Is love and unity&lt;br&gt;
to all God&amp;rsquo;s children&lt;br&gt;
It should never&lt;br&gt;
be a great event&lt;br&gt;
And the whole day&lt;br&gt;
should be spent&lt;br&gt;
In full remembrance&lt;br&gt;
of those&lt;br&gt;
Who lived and died&lt;br&gt;
for the oneness&lt;br&gt;
Of all people&lt;br&gt;
so let us all begin&lt;br&gt;
We know that&lt;br&gt;
love can win&lt;br&gt;
Let it out&lt;br&gt;
don&amp;rsquo;t hold it in&lt;br&gt;
Sing it loud&lt;br&gt;
as you can&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday to you&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday-&lt;br&gt;
Woo yeah&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday-&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday-&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday-&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday-&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday-&lt;br&gt;
Happy birthday&lt;br&gt;
happy birthday-&lt;/p&gt;
