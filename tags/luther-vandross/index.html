                Back when I was a child Before life removed all the innocence My father would lift me high And dance with my mother and Me and then spin me around til I fell asleep then up the stairs He would carry me and I knew for sure I was loved if I could get Another chance another walk Another dance with him Id play a song that would never ever end How Id love love love To dance with my father again Woo when I and my mother Would disagree to get my way I would run from her to him Hed make me laugh just to comfort me Yeah yeah then finally Make me do just what My mama said later that night When I was asleep he left a dollar Under my sheet never dreamed That he would be gone From me if I could steal One final glance one final step One final dance with him Id play a song that would never Ever end cause Id Love love love to dance with My father again sometimes Id listen Outside her door and Id hear how My mother cried for him I pray for her even more than me I pray for her even more than me  I know Im praying for much too much But could you send back The only man she loved I know you dont do it usually But dear Lord shes dying To dance with my father again Every night I fall asleep And this is all I ever dream
