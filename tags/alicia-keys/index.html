                Used to dream of being A millionaire without a care But if Im seeing my dreams And you arent there cause its over That just wont be fair darling Rather be a poor woman living On the street no food to eat Cause I dont want no pie if I have to cry Cause its over when you said goodbye All at once I had it all But it doesnt mean anything Now that youre gone From afar seems I had it all But it doesnt mean anything Since youre gone Now I see myself Through different eyes its no surprise What being alone would make you realize When its over all in love is fair I shoulda been there I shoulda been there I shoulda shoulda All at once I had it all But it doesnt mean anything Now that youre gone From afar seems I had it all But it doesnt mean anything Since youre gone I know I pushed you away What can I do that will save our love Take these material things They dont mean nothing Its you that I want All at once I had it all But it doesnt mean anything Now that youre gone From afar seems I had it all But it doesnt mean anything Since youre gone I shoulda been there I shoulda been there I shoulda shoulda All at once I had it all But it doesnt mean anything Now that youre gone From afar seems I had it all But it doesnt mean anything Since youre gone
