        &lt;p&gt;Hello darkness my old friend&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve come to talk with you again&lt;br&gt;
Because a vision softly creeping&lt;br&gt;
Left its seeds while I was sleeping&lt;br&gt;
And the vision that was planted in my brain&lt;br&gt;
Still remains&lt;br&gt;
Within the sound of silence&lt;br&gt;
In restless dreams I walked alone&lt;br&gt;
Narrow streets of cobblestone&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Neath the halo of a street lamp&lt;br&gt;
I turned my collar to the cold and damp&lt;br&gt;
When my eyes were stabbed by&lt;br&gt;
The flash of a neon light&lt;br&gt;
That split the night&lt;br&gt;
And touched the sound of silence&lt;br&gt;
And in the naked light I saw&lt;br&gt;
Ten thousand people maybe more&lt;br&gt;
People talking without speaking&lt;br&gt;
People hearing without listening&lt;br&gt;
People writing songs that voices never share&lt;br&gt;
And no one dared&lt;br&gt;
Disturb the sound of silence&lt;br&gt;
Fools said I you do not know&lt;br&gt;
Silence like a cancer grows&lt;br&gt;
Hear my words that I might teach you&lt;br&gt;
Take my arms that I might reach you&lt;br&gt;
But my words like silent raindrops fell&lt;br&gt;
And echoed in the wells of silence&lt;br&gt;
And the people bowed and prayed&lt;br&gt;
To the neon god they made&lt;br&gt;
And the sign flashed out its warning&lt;br&gt;
In the words that it was forming&lt;br&gt;
And the sign said&lt;br&gt;
The words of the prophets are&lt;br&gt;
Written on the subway walls&lt;br&gt;
And tenement halls&lt;br&gt;
And whispered in the sound of silence&lt;/p&gt;
