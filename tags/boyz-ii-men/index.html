                I long for the warmth of Days gone by when you were mine But now those days are memories in time Lifes empty without you by my side My heart belongs to you No matter what I try When I get the courage up To love somebody new it always falls apart Cause they just cant compare to you Your love wont release me Im bound under ball and chain Reminiscing our love As I watch 4 seasons change In comes the winter breeze That chills the air and drifts the snow And I imagine kissing you Under the mistletoe when springtime makes Its way here lilac blooms reminds me Of the scent of your perfume When summer burns with heat I always get the hots for you Go skinny dipping in the ocean Where we used to do when autumn Sheds the leaves the trees are bare When youre not here It doesnt feel the same Remember the night When we closed our eyes And vowed that you and I Would be in love for all time Every time I think about The things is shared with you I break down and cry Cause I get so emotional Until you release me Im bound under Ball and chain reminiscing our love As I watch 4 seasons change In comes the winter breeze That chills the air and drifts the snow And I imagine kissing you Under the mistletoe when springtime makes Its way here lilac blooms reminds me Of the scent of your perfume When summer burns with heat I always get the hots for you Go skinny dipping in the ocean Where we used to do when autumn Sheds the leaves the trees are bare When youre not here It doesnt feel the same This loneliness has crushed my heart Please let me love again Cause I need your love to comfort me And ease my pain or 4 seasons Will bring the loneliness again In comes the winter breeze That chills the air and drifts the snow And I imagine kissing you Under the mistletoe when springtime makes Its way here lilac blooms reminds me Of the scent of your perfume When summer burns with heat I always get the hots for you Go skinny dipping in the ocean Where we used to do when autumn Sheds the leaves the trees are bare When youre not here It doesnt feel the same Remember the warmth of days gone by
