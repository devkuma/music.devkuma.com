        &lt;p&gt;작곡: Sung by / 작사: Stephen Trask&lt;br&gt;
KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@KARAOKEKY/search?query=62087&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;62087&lt;/a&gt; / KY: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@TJKaraoke/search?query=20838&#34; target=&#34;_black&#34;&gt;20838&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the earth&lt;br&gt;
was still flat&lt;br&gt;
And the clouds&lt;br&gt;
made of fire&lt;br&gt;
And mountains&lt;br&gt;
stretched up&lt;br&gt;
To the sky&lt;br&gt;
sometimes higher&lt;br&gt;
Folks roamed&lt;br&gt;
the earth&lt;br&gt;
Like big&lt;br&gt;
rolling kegs&lt;br&gt;
They had&lt;br&gt;
two sets of arms&lt;br&gt;
They had&lt;br&gt;
two sets of legs&lt;br&gt;
They had&lt;br&gt;
two faces peering&lt;br&gt;
Out of&lt;br&gt;
one giant head&lt;br&gt;
So they could watch&lt;br&gt;
all around them&lt;br&gt;
As they talked&lt;br&gt;
while they read&lt;br&gt;
And they never knew&lt;br&gt;
nothing of love&lt;br&gt;
It was before&lt;br&gt;
the origin of love&lt;br&gt;
The origin&lt;br&gt;
of love&lt;br&gt;
And there were&lt;br&gt;
three sexes then&lt;br&gt;
One that looked&lt;br&gt;
like two men&lt;br&gt;
Glued up&lt;br&gt;
back to back&lt;br&gt;
Called the&lt;br&gt;
children of the sun&lt;br&gt;
And similar in&lt;br&gt;
shape and girth&lt;br&gt;
Were the children&lt;br&gt;
of the earth&lt;br&gt;
They looked&lt;br&gt;
like two girls&lt;br&gt;
Rolled up in one&lt;br&gt;
and the children&lt;br&gt;
Of the moon&lt;br&gt;
were like a fork&lt;br&gt;
Shoved on a spoon&lt;br&gt;
they were part sun&lt;br&gt;
Part earth&lt;br&gt;
part daughter&lt;br&gt;
Part son&lt;br&gt;
the origin of love&lt;br&gt;
Now the gods grew&lt;br&gt;
quite scared&lt;br&gt;
Of our strength&lt;br&gt;
and defiance&lt;br&gt;
And Thor said&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m gonna&lt;br&gt;
Kill them all&lt;br&gt;
with my hammer&lt;br&gt;
Like I killed&lt;br&gt;
the giants&lt;br&gt;
And Zeus said no&lt;br&gt;
you better let me&lt;br&gt;
Use my lightening&lt;br&gt;
like scissors&lt;br&gt;
Like I cut the legs&lt;br&gt;
off the whales&lt;br&gt;
And dinosaurs&lt;br&gt;
into lizards&lt;br&gt;
Then he grabbed up&lt;br&gt;
some bolts&lt;br&gt;
And he let&lt;br&gt;
out a laugh&lt;br&gt;
Said I&amp;rsquo;ll split&lt;br&gt;
them right&lt;br&gt;
Down the middle&lt;br&gt;
gonna cut them&lt;br&gt;
Right up in half&lt;br&gt;
and then storm clouds&lt;br&gt;
Gathered above&lt;br&gt;
into great&lt;br&gt;
Balls of fire and&lt;br&gt;
then fire shot down&lt;br&gt;
From the sky in bolts&lt;br&gt;
like shining blades&lt;br&gt;
Of a knife&lt;br&gt;
and it ripped&lt;br&gt;
Right through&lt;br&gt;
the flesh&lt;br&gt;
Of the children&lt;br&gt;
of the sun&lt;br&gt;
And the moon&lt;br&gt;
and the earth&lt;br&gt;
And some Indian god&lt;br&gt;
sewed the wound up&lt;br&gt;
Into a hole&lt;br&gt;
pulled it round&lt;br&gt;
To our belly&lt;br&gt;
to remind us&lt;br&gt;
Of the price we pay&lt;br&gt;
and Osiris&lt;br&gt;
And the gods&lt;br&gt;
of the Nile&lt;br&gt;
Gathered up&lt;br&gt;
a big storm&lt;br&gt;
To blow a hurricane&lt;br&gt;
to scatter us away&lt;br&gt;
In a flood of&lt;br&gt;
wind and rain&lt;br&gt;
And a sea of&lt;br&gt;
tidal waves&lt;br&gt;
To wash us all away&lt;br&gt;
and if we don&amp;rsquo;t behave&lt;br&gt;
They&amp;rsquo;ll cut us&lt;br&gt;
down again&lt;br&gt;
And we&amp;rsquo;ll be hopping&lt;br&gt;
round on one foot&lt;br&gt;
And looking&lt;br&gt;
through one eye&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time&lt;br&gt;
I saw you&lt;br&gt;
We had just&lt;br&gt;
split in two&lt;br&gt;
You were looking at me&lt;br&gt;
I was looking at you&lt;br&gt;
You had a way&lt;br&gt;
so familiar&lt;br&gt;
But I could not&lt;br&gt;
recognize&lt;br&gt;
Cause you had blood&lt;br&gt;
on your face&lt;br&gt;
I had blood&lt;br&gt;
in my eyes&lt;br&gt;
But I could swear&lt;br&gt;
by your expression&lt;br&gt;
That the pain down&lt;br&gt;
in your soul&lt;br&gt;
Was the same as&lt;br&gt;
the one down in mine&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s the pain&lt;br&gt;
cuts a straight line&lt;br&gt;
Down through the heart&lt;br&gt;
we called it love&lt;br&gt;
So we wrapped our arms&lt;br&gt;
around each other&lt;br&gt;
Trying to shove&lt;br&gt;
ourselves&lt;br&gt;
Back together&lt;br&gt;
we were making love&lt;br&gt;
Making love&lt;br&gt;
it was a cold&lt;br&gt;
Dark evening&lt;br&gt;
such a long time ago&lt;br&gt;
When by the mighty&lt;br&gt;
hand of Jove&lt;br&gt;
It was the sad story&lt;br&gt;
how we became&lt;br&gt;
Lonely two legged&lt;br&gt;
creatures&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s the story of&lt;br&gt;
the origin of love&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s the&lt;br&gt;
origin of love&lt;br&gt;
Origin of love&lt;br&gt;
origin of love&lt;br&gt;
Origin of&lt;br&gt;
love&lt;/p&gt;
