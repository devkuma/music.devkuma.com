                In the morning when the moon is At its rest you will find me At the time I love the best Watching rainbows play on sunlight Pools of water iced from cold nights In the morning tis the morning Of my life in the daytime I will meet you as before You will find me waiting By the ocean floor building castles In the shifting sands in a world That no one understands In the morning tis the morning Of my life tis the morning Of my life in the morning Of my life the minutes take So long to drift away please be patient With your life its only morning And youve still to live your day In the evening I will fly you To the moon to the top Right hand corner of the ceiling in my room Where well stay until the sun shines Another day to swing on closed lights May I be yearning tis the morning Of my life tis the morning Of my life in the morning In the morning in the morning
